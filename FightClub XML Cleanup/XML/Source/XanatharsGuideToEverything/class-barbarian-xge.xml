          <name>Primal Path&#58; Path of the Ancestral Guardian</name>
        <text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
        <text>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors&#39; deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

          <name>Primal Path&#58; Path of the Ancestral Guardian&#58; Ancestral Protectors</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you&#39;re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn&#39;t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</text>

          <name>Primal Path&#58; Path of the Storm Herald</name>
        <text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</text>
        <text>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world&#39;s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

          <name>Primal Path&#58; Path of the Storm Herald&#58; Storm Aura</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</text>
        <text>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura&#39;s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</text>
        <text>If your aura&#39;s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</text>

        <text>When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.</text>

        <text>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealotsâ€”warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.</text>
        <text>A variety of gods across the worlds of D&amp;D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.</text>

Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</text>
