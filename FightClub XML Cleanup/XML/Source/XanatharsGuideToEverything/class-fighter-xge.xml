          <name>Martial Archetype&#58; Arcane Archer</name>
        <text>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below).</text>
        <text>Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn&#39;t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class&#58; 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</text>

          <name>Martial Archetype&#58; Cavalier</name>
        <text>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</text>

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you&#39;re not incapacitated.</text>
        <text>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</text>

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</text>
        <text>While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn&#39;t target you.</text>
        <text>In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack&#39;s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.</text>
        <text>Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>

Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.</text>

If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you&#39;re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target&#39;s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack&#39;s damage.</text>
