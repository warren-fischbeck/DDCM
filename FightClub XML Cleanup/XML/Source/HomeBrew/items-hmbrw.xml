    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  The blade was forged in the icy breath of a long forgotten white dragon and as such the blade has a white, frosted look to it.  A giant milk quartz makes up the cross guard, the quartz is cut to resemble the outstretched limbs of a dragon, each claw clutching a blood red ruby.  The pommel is a circular disk with each side having the nine blades carved in it.  The hilt is wrapped in supple yeti hide.</text>
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  On a successful melee hit with the blade, the target takes an extra 3d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have vulnerability to fire damage.</text>
    <text>In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</text>
    <text>When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used once per short rest.</text>
    <text>Versatile&#58; This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property â€” the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This rapier has a darkened blade, hardened in an ancient black dragon&#39;s pool of acid. When drawn, the blade glistens with acid. The basket hilt is crafted of a copper mesh made to resemble the drowning vines that inhabit many bogs.  The grip is made of 7 glass beads that shows how much acid is left in the blade before it runs dry for the day.</text>
    <text>When the command word "vellious" is spoken as a bonus action, one of the doses of acid stored in the grip is transferred to the blade. On the next successful attack made with the blade, the weapon adds 1d6 acid damage.  The grip houses seven such doses, all used doses are replenished at dawn.</text>
    <text>When traveling through swamps, the bearer of this blade knows which way is north and cannot become lost.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This dagger crackles with lightning when drawn.  The blade is silvered and etched in ancient runes that names this blade as The Tooth of the Dragon.  The hilt and cross guard are shapped to resemble a blue dragon with outstretched wings.</text>
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  On a successful melee hit the blade, the target takes an extra 1d4 lightning damage, as lightning arcs from the wings of the dragon into the target. In addition, while you hold the dagger, you have resistance to lightning damage.</text>
    <text>When traveling through desert terrain the bearer of this blade cannot be surprised by any non-magical means.</text>

    <text>Range&#58; A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#39;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#39;s long range.</text>
    <text>Thrown&#58; If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This greatsword was forged in the firey breath of Veilendrex, an ancient red dragon.  It was he who started building the Mouth of the Dragon by enslaving wizards, sorcerers and clerics.  When drawn, the runes that race down the blade glow with red fury, spelling out Veilendrex &#42; the mouth of the dragon.  His gold tipped tail wraps around the blade close to the cross guard. His body makes up the hilt, each scale is encrusted with crushed red rubies.  His masive head is the pommel, sculpted in anger. Smoke wafts out of the mouth as the blade is swung in combat.</text>
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  You can use a bonus action to speak this sword&#39;s command word &#42; Veilendrex, causing flames to erupt from the blade.  These flames shead bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet.  While the sword is ablase, it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage to any target it hits.  The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have vulnerability to cold damage.</text>
    <text>Once per day the wielder of the blade can cast fireball as a 5th level spell, however the normal flame function will not work until the dawn of the following day.</text>
    <text>Heavy&#58; Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#39;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
    <text>Two-Handed&#58; This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

    <text>
      legendary (requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

      This spear can be wielded as a magic spear that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.
      The spear has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6+2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12+1 charges.

      Spell Absorption&#58; While holding the spear, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell&#39;s level. However, if doing so brings the spear&#39;s total number of charges above 50, the spear explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

      Spells&#58; While holding the spear, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability&#58; conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges)
      You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the spear without using any charges&#58; arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.

      Retributive Strike&#58; You can use an action to break the spear over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The spear is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.
      You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

      Distance from Origin â€” Damage&#58;
      10 ft. away or closer â€” 8 x the number of charges in the spear
      11 to 20 ft. away â€” 6 x the number of charges in the spear
      21 to 30 ft. away â€” 4 x the number of charges in the spear

    <text>This legendary shortsword is also known as a the Giant&#39;s hamstring, after the favored tactic of the renown fighter Qwalth.  In the age of Giants, Qwalth left the dwarven holds, along side his brethren, and joined battle to drive them back. This finely crafted mithril blade, golden crossguard and sapphire pommeled sword was almost as feared among the giants as Qwalth himself.  The legend of the pair during the wars was well warranted and often a turning point when they took the field.</text>
    <text>This shortsword grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</text>
    <text>When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon&#39;s type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.</text>

    <text>Rarity&#58; Legendary</text>
    <text>Requires Attunement by a Fighter (Battle Master) or someone with the feat&#58; Martial Adept</text>
    <text>Lendarth was a legendary hero of a bygone era.  His death dance was a thing of beauty, often causing even his opponents to stare in wonder as death descended.  He made a heroic sacrifice in the Lich Wars opening battle.  He fell holding a bridge as the defeated army retreated.  This was his greatest dance, laying waste to the Lich lords skeleton troops.  Something in that fight was absorbed by the bracers he wore, for when they were given to his next of kin, his dance could be seen in her fighting style.</text>
    <text>The bracers holds 5 charges.  It regains 1d4-1 expended charges daily at dawn.</text>
    <text>While wearing the bracers, as part of an attack action that uses a Battle Master Maneuver you can use one or more charges to increase the superiority die type by one category per charge expended. A d6 becomes a d8, d8 becomes a d10, d10 becomes a d12 and a d12 becomes a d20.</text>
    <text>If the bracers remain at 0 charges for two consecutive days, it&#39;s enchantment is broken and it is now considered a mundane set of brackers.</text>

    <text>Backbreaker was originally forged during THE SECOND AGE and used by the forces of the mind flayers. It eventually fell into the hands of the Slaad hero Crroock.

There Backbreaker was both a trophy and family heirloom weapon of the Umbra-Vastator family.  During The War of Elven Submission the blade was captured by the Order of the White Rose and placed in Boarderland&#39;s The Manor of Infinite Mirrors.</text>
