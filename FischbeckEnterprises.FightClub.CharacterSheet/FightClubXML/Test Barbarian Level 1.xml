          In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
          While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren&#39;t wearing heavy armor.

          • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

          • When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian. At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage. Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th.

          • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

          If you are able to cast spells, you can&#39;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
          Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven&#39;t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
          Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

            Bite

Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with your bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
            Claws
            Your hands transform into claws, which deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. When you take the Attack action on your turn and make an attack with your claws, you can make one additional attack using your claws as part of the same action.
            Tail
            You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d12 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property.

            Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

            Exhaustion:
            Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect&#39;s description.

            Level — Effect:
            1 —Disadvantage on ability checks
            2 —Speed halved
            3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
            4 —Hit point maximum halved
            5 —Speed reduced to 0
            6 —Death

            If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect&#39;s description.
            A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.
            An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect&#39;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature&#39;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
            Finishing a long rest reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

            Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.
            Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits&#39; help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors&#39; deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

            All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.
            Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world&#39;s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

            The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.
            Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

            Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.
            Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura&#39;s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whatever you gain a level in this class.
            if your aura&#39;s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

            Desert: When this affect is activated, all other creatures your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in his class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

            Sea: When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

            Tundra: When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits try to inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or b ones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
            Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

At the end of your turn, all spirits explode and each creature within 5 feet of one or more of them must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage.
            4 | Arcane energy enshrouds you. Until your rage ends, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, that creature takes force damage equal to your Constitution modifier.
            5 | Plant life temporarily grows around you: until your rage ends, the ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain.
            6 | Arcane energy taps into the minds of those around you. Each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed ona Wisdom saving throw or you see a glimpse of the creature&#39;s thoughts, learning how it plans to attack you. As a result, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
            7 | Shadows weave around a weapon of your choice you are holding. Until your rage ends, your weapon deals psychic damage instead of its bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, and it gains the light and thrown properties with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you drop the weapon or throw it, the weapon dissipates and reappears in your hand at the end of your turn.
            8 | A beam of brilliant light lances from your chest in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn.

            The feral spirit within you grows in power, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
            You can also call on the feral spirit to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest:
            • You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
            • You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
            • When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check&#39;s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.

            Desert: Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.

            Sea: When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

            Tundra: Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn as magical frost covers it.

            Prone:
            • A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

            • The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

            • An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

            Prone:
            • A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

            • The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

            • An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

        • On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

        • Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack&#39;s damage.
