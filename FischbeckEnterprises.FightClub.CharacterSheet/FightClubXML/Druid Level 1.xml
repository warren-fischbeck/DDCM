Cantrips:
    At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. 

Preparing and Casting Spells:
    The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier+your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#39;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
    You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 

Spellcasting Ability:
    Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

Ritual Casting:
    You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. 

Spellcasting Focus:
    You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.
These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn&#39;t the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.
Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

Circle Spells
   Your symbiotic link to fungus and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table.
   Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&#39;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&#39;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Druid Level | Circle Spells
3rd | blindness/deafness, gentle repose
5th | animate dead, gaseous form
7th | blight, confusion
9th | cloudkill, contagion

Halo of Spores
   Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

Symbiotic Entity
   At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
â€¢ When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
â€¢ Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to any target they hit.
   These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

Rule Tip: Temporary Hit Points Don&#39;t Stack
   If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don&#39;t add them together, unless a rule says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep. For more information on temporary hit points, see chapter 9 of the Player&#39;s Handbook.

These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.
    Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

     While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body takes on a luminous, starlike quality; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes or until you&#39;re incapacitated.
     Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:

Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + half your level in this class.
Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on you. You gain a bonus action that you can use to make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
 Dragon. A constellation of a wise, ancient dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

   You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.
   The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 fire damage.
   The wildfire spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature&#39;s game statistics in the wildfire spirit stat block. You determine the spirit&#39;s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.
   In combat, the wildfire spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, Help, or Hide action.
   The wildfire spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Wild Shape</name><text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
    Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player&#39;s Handbook, p. 66).
    At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&#39;t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn&#39;t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower.
    You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
    While you are transformed, the following rules apply.

â€¢ Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&#39;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#39;t use them.

â€¢ When you transform, you assume the beast&#39;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#39;t knocked unconscious.

â€¢ You can&#39;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&#39;t break your concentration on a spell you&#39;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&#39;ve already cast.

â€¢ You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&#39;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.

â€¢ You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#39;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#39;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#39;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
    The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

As an action, you conjure a burst of light in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 120 feet of you. You can immediately teleport each willing creature in the sphere to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it. Each creature remaining in the sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 4d10 radiant damage and be blinded until the end of your next turn.
Once you have used this action, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use it again.

    When you finish a short or long rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle.
    This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven&#39;t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn&#39;t wasted.
    Once you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Prone:
â€¢ A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

â€¢ The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

â€¢ An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

    This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

    The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell&#39;s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

    A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.

    After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.
