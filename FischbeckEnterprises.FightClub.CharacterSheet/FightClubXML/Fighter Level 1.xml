        <text>The Iron Route, once the primary trade route between Phlan and Zhentil Keep, used to be a site of extensive banditry until the Phlan&#39;s recent occupation. Your time as an erstwhile bandit has given you plenty of experience in the saddle and a knack for acquiring and appraising other people&#39;s mounts, pets, and vehicles among other things. This particular set of skills has become very lucrative for you by working for the underground as a horse thief for a local guild of thieves and other shadowy organizations.</text>

            Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.
            When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.

            Trick Shots: You learn two trick shots of your choice.  Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way.  Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made.  You can use only one trick shot per attack.
            You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.  Each time you learn a trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.

            Grit: You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).  You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM&#39;s discretion).  You gain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.


            Saving Throws: Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot&#39;s effect.  The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
            Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + Dexterity Modifier

You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn&#39;t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

            You get extra performance from any ranged weapon that you customize.  Customizing an item requires you to spend a short rest making modifications to it.  Once you complete this customization, you can do one of the following.  Add the finesse property to the customized item if it doesn&#39;t have it or remove the heavy condition if the customized item has it.

            You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

            Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties.  Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of their property.  These properties replace the optional ones presented in the DM guide.  Firearms are ranged weapons.
            RELOAD.  The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload.  You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.
            MISFIRE.  Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than weapon&#39;s Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it.  To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker&#39;s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + Misfire score).  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.
            SCATTER.  An attack is made against each creature within a 30 ft. cone.  These attacks are simultaneous.  If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage on a hit.  This attack cannot be affected by any of your shot features.
            EXPLOSIVE.  Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft. of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage.  If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

            An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

            A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.

            Manifest Echo
            3rd-level Echo Knight feature
            You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you&#39;re incapacitated.
            Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.
            You can use the echo in the following ways:
            • As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
            • When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo&#39;s space. You make this choice for each attack.
            • When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo&#39;s space.

            Unleash Incarnation
            3rd-level Echo Knight feature
            You can heighten your echo&#39;s fury. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo&#39;s position.
            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

            The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter&#39;s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

            The archetypical eminusque is a master of ranged combat.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you are engaging a foe with a bow, a thrown dagger or a net, you are able to push the limits of what is possible with any ranged weapon.  Your training and education has made you the pinicle of distanced fighting and you can rain down devistating blows.

            Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or polearm tactics.  Whether the duelist of infantry martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them.
            However, some minds couldn&#39;t stop with the innovation of the crossbow.  Experimentation with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets of controlled explosive force.  The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.
            This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons.  Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield.  However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack.  This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.
            Should this path of powder, fire and metal call to you, keep your wits about you, hold onto your convictions as a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike true.

            Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom&#39;s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.
            A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.
            A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&#39;s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.

            You discovered how to enhance your martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes. The ancient practice of rune magic originated with giants. {@i Skiltgravr} ("rune cutters") can be found among any type of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant&#39;s work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a traveling sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant&#39;s craft. In time, you learned how to carve and apply runes to your equipment and how to invoke their magic, ultimately becoming a Rune Knight.

            You learn how to use runes to enhance your gear. When you gain this feature, you learn how to inscribe two runes of your choice on weapons, armor, or shields (see "Rune Options").
            Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, or a shield.
            Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes.
            Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one.

            Rune Options
            Rune options are all magical effects. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

            When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

            Cantrips: You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

            Spell Slots: The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.

            Spells Known of 1st-level and Higher: You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
            The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
            The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
            Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you&#39;re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

            Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

            Spell save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
            Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

            Trick Shots: You learn three trick shots of your choice. Many trick shots enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one trick shot per attack.
            You learn two additional trick shots of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new trick shots, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.

            Superiority Dice: You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
            You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

            Saving Throws: Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot&#39;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
            Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +  Strngth or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

When you hit a creature with a  melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn.

            While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn&#39;t target you.
            In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack&#39;s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.
            Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

            Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can&#39;t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
            You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze.

This magic can transfer the attack regardless of the attack&#39;s range. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            Your attacks can channel psychic agony. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can also deal 2d10 psychic damage to that target and force it to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unless the save succeeds, the target falls prone, and it suffers disadvantage on ability checks until the end of your next turn.
            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren&#39;t incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC * + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

            Prone:
            • A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

            • The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

            • An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

            This rune&#39;s magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            In addition, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes  2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your Strength score by 2 for 10 minutes. This increase can cause your score to exceed 20, but not 30. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker), using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack regardless of the attack&#39;s range. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
            In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you&#39;re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke the rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            At 18th level, you can make shots that no-one else can make.
            When you take the Attack action, you double the long range of any ranged weapon you are proficient with and the first successful attack roll using this feature is treated as a critical hit.

            Once you use this feature you can&#39;t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

            At 18th level, your firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and you regain a grit point on a roll of 19 or 20 on a d20 attack roll with a firearm.

            Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature&#39;s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make opportunity attacks, and you can&#39;t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

            When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&#39;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
            If your DM uses the optional Feats, you can instead take a feat.

            19th-level feature (enhances Ability Score Improvement)
            When you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from your class, you can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn&#39;t be from the class).
            This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.
