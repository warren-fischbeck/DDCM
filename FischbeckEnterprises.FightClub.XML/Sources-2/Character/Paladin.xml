        <name>Divine Sense</name>
        <text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</text>
        <text>    You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Lay on Hands</name>
        <text>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.</text>
        <text>    As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</text>
        <text>    Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</text>
        <text>    This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</text>

		    <name>Martial Versatility (UA)</name>
		    <text>Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style. </text>

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
        <text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>    For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
        <text>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</text>

        <name>Sacred Oath</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, the Oath of the Crown, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the c1ass description.</text>
        <text>    Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Ancients</name>
        <text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things - leaves, antlers, or flowers - to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Tenets of the Ancients</text>
        <text />
        <text>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</text>
        <text>    Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</text>
        <text>    Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</text>
        <text>    Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</text>
        <text>    Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</name>
        <text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels - the perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Tenets of Devotion</text>
        <text />
        <text>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</text>
        <text>    Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</text>
        <text>    Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
        <text>    Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
        <text>    Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
        <text>    Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance</name>
        <text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins - sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Tenets of Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</text>
        <text>    Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</text>
        <text>    No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</text>
        <text>    By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.</text>
        <text>    Restitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oathbreaker (DMG)</name>
        <text>An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.</text>
        <text>    A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.</text>

As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</text>

For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest (XGE)</name>
        <text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order.  They must crush the forces of chaos.  Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy.  The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins - called hell knights - as his most ardent supporters.  Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords.  These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered to far into darkness.</text>

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath:  Oath of Redemption (XGE)</name>
        <text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort.  Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk.  These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives.  Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>
        <text />
        <text>While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools.  Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil.  Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear.  Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>
        <text>Tenants of Redemption</text>
        <text />
        <text>The tenants of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to high standard of peace and justice.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Peace.  Violence is a weapon of last resort.  Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Innocence.  All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark force that drives them to evil.  By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Patience.  Change takes time.  Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true.  Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Wisdom.  Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat.  While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good.  Any such action must be carefully weighted and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>
