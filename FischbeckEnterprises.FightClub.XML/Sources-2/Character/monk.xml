    <feature>
      <name>Ki</name>
      <text>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</text>
      <text>    You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</text>
      <text>    When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</text>
      <text>    Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Shadow</name>
      <text>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Open Hand</name>
      <text>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements</name>
      <text>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Long Death</name>
      <text>Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments of their demise. They use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Sun Soul</name>
      <text>Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.</text>
    </feature>

    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Open Hand: Open Hand Technique</name>
      <text>You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.</text>
      <text />
      <text>- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</text>
      <text />
      <text>- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</text>
      <text />
      <text>- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements: Disciple of the Elements</name>
      <text>You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</text>
      <text />
      <text>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</text>
      <text />
      <text>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</text>

    <feature>
      <name>Deflect Missiles</name>
      <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</text>
      <text>    If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20 feet/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</text>

You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels &#8212; to a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.</text>

      <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Kensei (XGE)</name>
      <text>Monks of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body.  Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.</text>
      <text />
      <text>A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush.  Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and percision of the martial arts.  That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.</text>
    </feature>
    <feature optional="YES">
    <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Kensei (XGE): Path of the Kensei</name>

      <text />
      <text>Kensei Weapons.  Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons:  one melee weapon and on ranged weapon.  Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties.  The longbow is also a valid choice.  You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it.  Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you.  Many of this traditions features work only with your kensei weapons.  When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon - either melee or ranged - to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Agile Parry. If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon.  You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Kensei's Shot. You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly.  When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type.  You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</text>
