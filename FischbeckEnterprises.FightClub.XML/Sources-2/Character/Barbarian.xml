      <feature>
        <name>Rage</name>
        <text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</text>
        <text>    While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</text>
        <text />
        <text>- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
        <text>- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.</text>
        <text>- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
        <text />
        <text>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>
        <text>    Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</text>
        <text>    Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.  You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>

        <name>Danger Sense</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">

      <feature>
        <name>Reckless Attack</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.

      <feature>
        <name>Primal Path</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker</name>
        <text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior</name>
        <text>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Battlerager</name>
        <text>Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Battlerager: Restriction - Dwarves Only</name>
        <text>Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Your DM can lift this restriction to better suite the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Battlerager: Battlerager Armor</name>
        <text>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor as a weapon.</text>
        <text />
        <text>While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes at a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker: Frenzy</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior: Spirit Seeker</name>
        <text>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior: Totem Spirit</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment â€” that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</text>
        <text>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Totem Spirit (Bear)</name>

        <text>While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Totem Spirit (Elk)</name>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Totem Spirit (Wolf)</name>

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian (XGE)</name>
        <text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
        <text>	Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits' help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them.</text>
        <text>	In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian (XGE): Ancestral Protectors</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you rage.  While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks.  Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack.  The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Storm Herald (XGE)</name>
        <text>All barbarians harbor a fury within.  Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed.  Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them.  When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</text>
        <text>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

        <text>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.  Choose desert, sea, or tundra.  Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below.  You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</text>

        <text />
        <text>Sea. When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura.  The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
