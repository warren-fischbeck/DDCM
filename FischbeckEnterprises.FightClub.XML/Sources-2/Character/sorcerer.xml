      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Cantrips</text>
        <text>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
        <text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</text>
        <text>    You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Sorcerous Origin</name>
        <text>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, Wild Magic, Favored Soul, or Storm Sorcerer.</text>
        <text>    Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Draconic Bloodline</name>
        <text>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic</name>
        <text>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Storm</name>
        <text>Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it. Your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinni. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your soul.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Draconic Bloodline: Dragon Ancestor</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.</text>
        <text />
        <text>chose one and delete the others</text>
        <text>Draconic Ancestor: Black (Acid)</text>

        <text>Draconic Ancestor: White (Cold)</text>
        <text />
        <text>You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your Proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Draconic Bloodline: Draconic Resilience</name>
        <text>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Storm: Tempestuous Magic</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Storm: Wind Speaker</name>
        <text>The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. (Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic: Wild Magic Surge</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. A Wild Magic Surge can happen once per turn.</text>
        <text />
        <text>    If a Wild Magic effect is a spell, it's too wild to be affected by Metamagic. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.</text>

        <text />
        <text>- The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</text>
        <text>- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</text>
        <text>- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.  The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</text>
        <text>- At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location.  If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</text>
        <text />
        <text>The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target.  Roll initiative for the hound.  On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target.  The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target.  Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</text>

Whatever the cause, the magic of the storm permeates your being.</text>
