        <name>Cantrip Versatility (UA)</name>
        <text>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.</text>

    </autolevel>

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature>
        <name>Arcane Recovery</name>
        <text>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
        <text>    For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.</text>
        <text>    You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Cantrips</text>
        <text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellbook</text>
        <text>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
        <text>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>    For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
        <text />
        <text>Ritual Casting</text>
        <text>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
        <text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</text>

    </autolevel>

    <autolevel level="2">
      <feature>
        <name>Arcane Tradition</name>
        <text>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Bladesinging, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Abjuration</name>
        <text>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Bladesinger</name>
        <text>Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Conjuration</name>
        <text>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Divination</name>
        <text>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Enchantment</name>
        <text>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Evocation</name>
        <text>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Illusion</name>
        <text>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists - including many gnome wizards - are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Transmutation</name>
        <text>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Necromancy</name>
        <text>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Abjuration: Abjuration Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Abjuration: Arcane Ward</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</text>
        <text>    While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</text>
        <text>    Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Conjuration: Conjuration Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Conjuration: Minor Conjuration</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.</text>
        <text>    The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Divination: Divination Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Divination: Portent</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.</text>
        <text>    Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Enchantment: Enchantment Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Enchantment: Hypnotic Gaze</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.</text>
        <text>    On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</text>
        <text>    Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Evocation: Evocation Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Evocation: Sculpt Spells</name>
        <text>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Illusion: Illusion Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Illusion: Improved Minor Illusion</name>
        <text>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.</text>
        <text>    When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Necromancy: Necromancy Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Necromancy: Grim Harvest</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Transmutation: Transmutation Savant</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Transmutation: Minor Alchemy</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bladesinger: Restriction: Elves Only</name>
        <text>Only elves and half-elves can choose the bladesinger arcane tradition. In the world of Faer&#251;n, elves closely guard the secrets of bladesinging.</text>
        <text>    Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction reflects the story of bladesingers in the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bladesinger: Training in War and Song (Bladesinging)</name>
        <text>When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.</text>
        <text>    You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it.</text>
        <proficiency>Performance</proficiency>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bladesinger: Bladesong</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.</text>
        <text>    You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).</text>
        <text>    While your bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:</text>
        <text/>
        <text>- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</text>
        <text>- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
        <text>- You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</text>
        <text>- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throws you make to maintain concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Divination: Expert Divination</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Enchantment: Instinctive Charm</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.</text>

        <text>    Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:</text>
        <text />
        <text>- The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.</text>

        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</text>
        <text />
        <text>- Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8</text>
        <text>- An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</text>
        <text>- Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</text>
        <text>- Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</text>
        <text />
        <text>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</text>
        <text>    If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Illusion: Illusory Reality</name>
        <text>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute.

        <text>    Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</text>

When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    Major Transformation. You can transmute one nonmagical object - no larger than a 5-foot cube - into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</text>
        <text>    Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</text>
        <text>    Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: War Magic (XGE)</name>
        <text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war.  The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools.  It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Followers of this tradition are known as war mages.  They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any peice of steel.  War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation.  Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack.  War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.</text>
        <text />
        <text>In great battles, a war mage often works with envokers, abjurers and other types of wizards.  Envokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.  A war mage's typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"</text>
