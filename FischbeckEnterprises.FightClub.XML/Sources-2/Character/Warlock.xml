        <text>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice - the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey</name>
        <text>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</text>
        <text />

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Fiend</name>
        <text>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</text>

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Great Old One</name>
        <text>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Expanded Spell List: The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Undying</name>
        <text>Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize - like all power - comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.</text>
        <text>    In the Realms, Undying patrons include Larloch the Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock's Crypt, and Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Expanded Spell List:</text>
        <text>    The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</text>

        <text>1st - false life, ray of sickness</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey: Fey Presence</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</text>
        <text>    Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Fiend: Dark One's Blessing</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Great Old One: Awakened Mind</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Undying: Among the Dead</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Pact Magic</name>
        <text>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Cantrips</text>
        <text>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>    For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
        <text>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
        <text>    You learn a new warlock spell every time you gain a level from 2 through 9, as well as at level 19. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>    Spell save DC: 8 + Proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>    Spell attack modifier: Proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
        <text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</text>
      </feature>
    </autolevel>
    <autolevel level="2">
      <feature>
        <name>Eldritch Invocations</name>
        <text>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</text>
        <text>    At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.</text>

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Talisman (UA)</name>
        <text>
          Your patron gives you a special amulet, a talisman that can aid you, or anyone else who wears it, when the need is great. When the wearer makes an ability check with a skill in which they lack proficiency, they can add a d4 to the roll.
          If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1hour ceremony to receive a  replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet.
          The talisman turns to ash when you die.
        </text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain</name>
        <text>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</text>
        <text>    When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</text>
        <text>    Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Blade</name>
        <text>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
        <text>    Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</text>
        <text>    You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome</name>
        <text>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</text>

You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.

          As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn.  You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible.

          A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
          You can cast the sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.
          As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching the name on it.

When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level.  Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns.  It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of + 0).</text>
        <text />
        <text>The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature until you finish a long rest.</text>

        <text>At 10th level, your hex rows more powerful.  IF the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6.  On a 4 or higher, the attack misses you, regardless of its roll.</text>

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature.  When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.  When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously curesed creature.</text>
