    <description>
      Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.

      Enemies Of Elemental Evil
      In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.
      On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the windunburdened and ever moving&#45; yet they watch over a region for years if that&#39;s what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.
      Aarakocra have no concept of political borders or property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and other precious materials means little to aarakocra. In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.

      Search For The Seven Shards
      The Wind Dukes of Aaqa come from a race of elemental beings called the vaati, which once ruled many worlds. A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplanar war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty Rod of Law. In a battle against the queen&#39;s greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear. The rod shattered into seven shards that scattered across the multiverse. Aaracokra seek signs of the pieces&#39; locations in order to rebuild what is now know as the Rod of Seven Parts.

    <description>
      Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths&#39; empire and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.

      Eternal Memories
      Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds. Aboleths&#39; minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth&#39;s plan.

      Gods In The Lake
      Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.
      Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature&#39;s loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.

      Enemies Of The Gods
      The aboleths&#39; fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth&#39;s body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.
      Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.

      AN ABOLETH&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      ----------------------------------------
      When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects
      &#45; The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can&#39;t take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth&#39;s phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.
      &#45; Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can&#39;t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.
      &#45; Water in the aboleth&#39;s lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature&#39;s rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can&#39;t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.

      Regional Effects
      The region containing an aboleth&#39;s lair is warped by the creature&#39;s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#45; Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth&#39;s lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.
      &#45; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.
      &#45; As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image&#39;s position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.

      If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLACK DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most evil-tempered --and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.
      With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon&#39;s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon&#39;s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon&#39;s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.
      When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.

      Brutal and Cruel.
      All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.
      A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.

      Foes and Servants.
      Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.
      Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master&#39;s domain.
      A black dragon&#39;s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon&#39;s lair.
      Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon&#39;s hunger.

      Wealth of the Ancients.
      Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.

      A BLACK DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon&#39;s lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills,,watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
      &#8226; A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&#39;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#39;t illuminate it. If any of the effect&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary black dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
      &#8226; Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over ld10 days.

    <description>
      Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn&#39;t sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.

      Beyond Death.
      A dracolich retains its shape and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence of its undead mind.
      Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.

      Dracolich Phylacteries.
      Creating a dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions like a lich&#39;s phylactery. As the dragon&#39;s flesh rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon&#39;s bones.
      If a dracolich&#39;s physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with another dragon&#39;s corpse, the dracolich&#39;s spirit can take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the dracolich&#39;s spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich&#39;s spirit has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.

      DRACOLICH TEMPLATE
      ----------------------------------------
      Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures that aren&#39;t true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can&#39;t be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.
      When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.

      Type.
      The dracolich&#39;s type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

      Damage Resistance.
      The dracolich has resistance to necrotic damage.

      Damage Immunities.
      The dracolich has immunity to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to becoming a dracolich.

      Condition Immunities.
      The dracolich can&#39;t be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also doesn&#39;t suffer from exhaustion.

      Magic Resistance.
      The dracolich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLUE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert&#39;s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
      A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
      A blue dragon&#39;s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

      Vain and Deadly.
      A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
      A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm&#39;s reach as it waits to attack again.

      Desert Predators.
      Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon&#39;s eye.
      When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

      Overlords and Minions.
      Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
      A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

      Hoarders of Gems.
      Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
      A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

      A BLUE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
      Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon&#39;s first line of defense.
      A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions&#45; along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC l5 constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      &#8226; Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#39;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
      &#8226; Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#39;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (&#45; 5).
      &#8226; Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#39;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.

      If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRASS DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.
      A brass dragon&#39;s head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling&#39;s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon&#39;s scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.

      Boldly Talkative
      A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a·brass dragon&#39;s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon&#39;s thirst for small talk is slaked.
      A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.

      Prized Treasures
      Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.
      Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon&#39;s hoard.

      A BRASS DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      A brass dragon&#39;s desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary brass dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.
      &#8226; Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#39;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
      &#8226; Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#39;s presence and location.

      If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.

      BRONZE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.
      A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon&#39;s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling&#39;s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon&#39;s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.

      Dragons of the Coast
      Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship&#39;s captain for the item.

      War Machines
      Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use. When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.

      Well-Organized Wealth
      Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies&#39; means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.

      A BRONZE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.
      &#8226; Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1dl0 days.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      COPPER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite , their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.
      A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon&#39;s scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon&#39;s pupils fade with age, and .the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

      Good Hosts
      A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous .story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn&#39;t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.
      Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

      Cautious and Crafty
      When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.
      A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.

      A COPPER DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary copper dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Magic carvings of the dragon&#39;s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#39;t divulge its whereabouts.
      &#8226; Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.

      If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.

      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GOLD DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.
      A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon&#39;s sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.

      Devourer of Wealth
      Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn&#39;t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren&#39;t bribes.

      Reserved Shapeshifters
      Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.
      Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.

      Master Hoarders
      A gold dragon keeps its hoard ina well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.

      A GOLD DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon&#39;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary gold dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.
      &#8226; Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The mist doesn&#39;t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil cveatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.
      &#8226; Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.

      If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GREEN DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
      A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
      A wyrmling green dragon&#39;s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
      A green dragon&#39;s legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

      Capricious Hunters
      A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
      Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can he&#39;lp it further its ambitions.
      A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures&#39; activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

      Manipulative Schemers
      A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
      When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

      Conflict and Corruption
      Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades&#45; for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
      Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions&#39; minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions&#39; tortured dreams.

      Living Treasures
      A green dragon&#39;s favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

      A GREEN DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon&#39;s wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature&#39;s poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches, the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
      At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#39;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary green dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement.  A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.
      Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#39;s path.
      &#8226; Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair serve as the dragon&#39;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

      If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.

Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons.

      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it.

      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano.

      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      RED DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
      The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that  metal burned blue by fire.
      The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

      Mountain Masters
      Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

      Arrogant Tyrants
      Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
      No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

      Status and Slaves
      Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
      When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn&#39;t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe&#39;s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

      Obsessive Collectors
      Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
      A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item&#39;s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can&#39;t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

      A RED DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
      With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.
      Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon&#39;s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser&#39;s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      &#8226; A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      &#8226; Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.


      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary red dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
      &#8226; Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

      If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1dl0 days.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      SILVER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.
      A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling&#39;s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.

      Dragons of Virtue
      Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one&#39;s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don&#39;t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

      Friends of the Small Races
      Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong frieqdships.
      Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.

      Respect for Humanity
      Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don&#39;t. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.

      Hoarding History
      Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.

      A SILVER DRAGON&#39;s LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (iosing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A blistering cold wind. blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1dl0) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary silver dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#39;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.
      &#8226; Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.

      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      WHITE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.
      A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.

      Primal and Vengeful
      White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.
      A white dragon a lso keeps the bodies of its greatest enerriies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon&#39;s lair as warnings to intruders.
      Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites.  White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.

      Lone Masters
      White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.

      White dragons can&#39;t abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon&#39;s wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.
      Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon&#39;s obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon&#39;s lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.

      Treasure Under Ice
      White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.
      Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon&#39;s lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon&#39;s breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon&#39;s great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon&#39;s main hoard.
      A white dragon&#39;s flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.

      A WHITE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.
      A legendary white dragon&#39;s innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon&#39;s presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.
      A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary white dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.
      &#8226; Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#39;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
      If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.

      If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.

    <description>
      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      AIR ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face. Although it likes to race across the ground, picking up dust and debris as it goes, it can also fly and attack from above.
      An air elemental can turn itself into a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures even as it flings them away.

If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      ALLOSAURUS

      The allosaurus is a predator possessing great size, strength, and speed. It can run down almost any prey over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with its wicked claws.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLACK DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most evil-tempered --and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.
      With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon&#39;s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon&#39;s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon&#39;s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.
      When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.

      Brutal and Cruel.
      All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.
      A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.

      Foes and Servants.
      Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.
      Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master&#39;s domain.
      A black dragon&#39;s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon&#39;s lair.
      Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon&#39;s hunger.

      Wealth of the Ancients.
      Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.

      A BLACK DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon&#39;s lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills,,watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
      &#8226; A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&#39;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#39;t illuminate it. If any of the effect&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary black dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
      &#8226; Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over ld10 days.

They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLUE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert&#39;s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
      A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
      A blue dragon&#39;s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

      Vain and Deadly.
      A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
      A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm&#39;s reach as it waits to attack again.

      Desert Predators.
      Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon&#39;s eye.
      When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

      Overlords and Minions.
      Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
      A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

      Hoarders of Gems.
      Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
      A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

      A BLUE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
      Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon&#39;s first line of defense.
      A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions&#45; along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC l5 constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      &#8226; Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#39;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
      &#8226; Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#39;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (&#45; 5).
      &#8226; Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#39;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.

      If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRASS DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.
      A brass dragon&#39;s head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling&#39;s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon&#39;s scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.

      Boldly Talkative
      A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a·brass dragon&#39;s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon&#39;s thirst for small talk is slaked.
      A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.

      Prized Treasures
      Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.
      Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon&#39;s hoard.

      A BRASS DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      A brass dragon&#39;s desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary brass dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.
      &#8226; Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#39;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
      &#8226; Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#39;s presence and location.

      If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRONZE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.
      A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon&#39;s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling&#39;s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon&#39;s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.

      Dragons of the Coast
      Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship&#39;s captain for the item.

      War Machines
      Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use. When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.

      Well-Organized Wealth
      Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies&#39; means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.

      A BRONZE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.
      &#8226; Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1dl0 days.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      COPPER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite , their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.
      A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon&#39;s scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon&#39;s pupils fade with age, and .the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

      Good Hosts
      A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous .story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn&#39;t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.
      Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

      Cautious and Crafty
      When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.
      A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.

      A COPPER DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary copper dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Magic carvings of the dragon&#39;s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#39;t divulge its whereabouts.
      &#8226; Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.

      If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GOLD DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.
      A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon&#39;s sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.

      Devourer of Wealth
      Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn&#39;t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren&#39;t bribes.

      Reserved Shapeshifters
      Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.
      Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.

      Master Hoarders
      A gold dragon keeps its hoard ina well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.

      A GOLD DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon&#39;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary gold dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.
      &#8226; Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The mist doesn&#39;t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil cveatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.
      &#8226; Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.

      If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GREEN DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
      A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
      A wyrmling green dragon&#39;s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
      A green dragon&#39;s legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

      Capricious Hunters
      A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
      Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can he&#39;lp it further its ambitions.
      A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures&#39; activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

      Manipulative Schemers
      A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
      When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

      Conflict and Corruption
      Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades&#45; for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
      Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions&#39; minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions&#39; tortured dreams.

      Living Treasures
      A green dragon&#39;s favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

      A GREEN DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon&#39;s wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature&#39;s poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches, the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
      At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#39;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary green dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement.  A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.
      Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#39;s path.
      &#8226; Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair serve as the dragon&#39;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

      If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      RED DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
      The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that  metal burned blue by fire.
      The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

      Mountain Masters
      Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

      Arrogant Tyrants
      Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
      No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

      Status and Slaves
      Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
      When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn&#39;t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe&#39;s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

      Obsessive Collectors
      Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
      A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item&#39;s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can&#39;t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

      A RED DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
      With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.
      Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon&#39;s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser&#39;s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      &#8226; A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      &#8226; Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.


      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary red dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
      &#8226; Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

      If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1dl0 days.

      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years

      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      SILVER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.
      A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling&#39;s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.

      Dragons of Virtue
      Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one&#39;s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don&#39;t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

      Friends of the Small Races
      Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong frieqdships.
      Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.

      Respect for Humanity
      Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don&#39;t. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.

      Hoarding History
      Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.

      A SILVER DRAGON&#39;s LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (iosing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A blistering cold wind. blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1dl0) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary silver dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#39;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.
      &#8226; Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      WHITE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.
      A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.

      Primal and Vengeful
      White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.
      A white dragon a lso keeps the bodies of its greatest enerriies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon&#39;s lair as warnings to intruders.
      Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites.  White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.

      Lone Masters
      White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.

      White dragons can&#39;t abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon&#39;s wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.
      Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon&#39;s obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon&#39;s lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.

      Treasure Under Ice
      White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.
      Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon&#39;s lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon&#39;s breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon&#39;s great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon&#39;s main hoard.
      A white dragon&#39;s flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.

      A WHITE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.
      A legendary white dragon&#39;s innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon&#39;s presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.
      A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary white dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.
      &#8226; Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#39;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
      If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.

      If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.

      This empty steel shell clamors as it moves, heavy plates banging and grinding against one another like the vengeful spirit of a fallen knight. Ponderous but persistent, this magical guardian is almost always a suit of plate armor.
      To add to its menace, animated armor is frequently enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare suits of animated armor are able to carry on an actual conversation.

      Animated Objects
      Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.

      Constructed Nature
      An animated object doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

      An ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged insect, its long antennae twitching in response to any movement around it. Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.

      Lurkers In The Earth
      The ankheg uses its powerful mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and. seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.

      Bane Of Field And Forest
      Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg&#39;s prime hunting gro-nds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.

      Earthen Tunnels
      As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature&#39;s attack.

      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      ANKYLOSAURUS
      ----------------------------------------
      Thick armor plating covers the body of the plant-eating ankylosaurus, which defends itself against predators with a knobbed tail that delivers a devastating strike. Some varieties of ankylosaurus have spiked tails that deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

      Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

      Faces of Evil
      Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.
      All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity. claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

      Monstrous Motherhood
      Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother&#39;s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.
      Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

      Dark Bargains
      Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.
      Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dearespecially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

      A Foul Nature
      Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, s uppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.
      This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag&#39;s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant&#39;s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

      Dark Sorority
      Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don&#39;t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag&#39;s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag&#39;s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags&#45; as long as the oath isn&#39;t given with the fingers crossed.
      Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags&#39; rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

      Dark Lairs
      Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag&#39;s lair reflects the creature&#39;s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

      HAG COVENS
      ----------------------------------------
      When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
      A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

      Shared Spellcasting
      While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&#39;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:
      1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
      2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
      3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
      4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
      5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
      6th level (1 slot): eye bite

      For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier.

      Hag Eye
      A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
      A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

    <description>
      Native&#39;s of the Elemental Plane of Fire, azers are mast-r crafters, expert miners, and sworn foes of the efreet. In appearance and manner, an azer resembles a male dwarf, but this is a facade. Beneath its metalliclooking skin, an azer is a being of fire, which outwardly manifests in its fiery hair and beard.

      Made, Not Born
      Azers don&#39;t reproduce. They are each crafted from bronze by another azer and imbued with a portion of the crafter&#39;s inner flame. Each azer is sculpted with unique features. This crafting process limits the growth of the azer population and is the primary reason that these creatures remain rare.

      Volcanic Dwellers
      Azers dwell in a kingdom on the border between the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Elemental Plane of Fire&#45; a range of mountains and volcanoes whose spires rise as a series of fortresses. Beneath mountain peaks, under volcanic calderas, and amid rivers of magma, azers extract gleaming metals and glittering gems from the earth. Squads of azer patrol the passes and tunnels of their realm, fending off the salamander raiders whose efreet masters order strikes against the azer kingdom.

      Enemies Of The Efreet
      Long ago, the efreet and the azers were allies. Azers helped create the City of Brass, forging that home of t4e efreet into one of the most wondrous places in creation. When the azers had finished their work, the efreet betrayed them, making a failed attempt to enslave the azers so as to protect the secrets of the city. Despite occasional raids and skirmishes, however, the two sides have so far refrained from all-out conflict. The azers believe that only the threat of them revealing the hidden ways into the City of Brass keeps the efreet in check.

      Masters Of Metal And Gems
      Azers are masterful artisans, and create beautiful works frpm the gems and precious metals found in their volcanic habitat. They rate the value of such treasures above all other things, sometimes dispatching parties across the planes to seek out rare metals and gemstones.
      When azers are called by magic to the Material Plane, it is typically to help forge an elaborate magic item or work of art, for it is said that their skill in such craft knows no equal.

      Living Fire
      An azer doesn&#39;t require food, drink, or sleep.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.

      Spawn Of Chaos
      The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      Capricious Elevation
      Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      Abyssal Invasions
      Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      Signs Of Corruption
      Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      Eternal Evil
      Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      Protected Essence
      A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      Demonic Cults
      Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      Demon Summoning
      Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      Bound Demons
      The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      Demonic Possession
      No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      BALOR
      ----------------------------------------
      Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them.
      Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that channels the power of the storm, a balor&#39;s battle prowess is fuled by hatred and rage.  It channels this demonic fury in its death throes falling witihin a blast of fire that can destroy even the hadiest foes.

    <description>
      When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf.
      Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee&#39;s face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.

      Divine Wrath
      Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by the banshee&#39;s curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the Jiving. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes their transformation into undead monsters.

      Sorrow Bound
      A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every moment of its life with perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for its doom.

      Beauty Hoarders
      The vanity that inspired the banshee&#39;s cursed creatipn persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine jewelry, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can&#39;t bear to see the horror of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.

      Undead Nature
      A banshee doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      Devils
      ----------------------------------------
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.

      Lords Of Tyranny
      Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.

      Obedience And Ambition
      In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.

      Dark Dealers And Soul Mongers
      Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      The Infernal Hierarchy
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.

      Archdevils
      The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.

      Greater Devils
      The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.

      Lesser Devils
      The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.

      Lemures
      The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.

      Promotion And Demotion
      When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      Infernal Hierarchy
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil
      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend
      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive. No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.

      The Nine Hells
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      BARBED DEVIL
      ----------------------------------------
      Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.
      Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.

    <description>
      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.

      Spawn Of Chaos
      The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      Capricious Elevation
      Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      Abyssal Invasions
      Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      Signs Of Corruption
      Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      Eternal Evil
      Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      Protected Essence
      A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      Demonic Cults
      Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      Demon Summoning
      Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      Bound Demons
      The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      Demonic Possession
      No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      BARLGURA
      ----------------------------------------
      The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss.  Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher fores, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.
      A barlgura looks like a hulking oragutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw.  Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds.  It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.

    <description>
      Travelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby.
      ADAPTABLE PREDATORS. Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.
      A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.
      GAZE OF STONE. Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn&#39;t chase prey. Meeting a basilisk&#39;s supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk&#39;s gullet.
      Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk&#39;s gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return petrified creatures to flesh and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain absent if the creature revives. Revivification using the oil is impossible if a vital part of the petrified creature, such as its head, is detached.

On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>A creature that isn&#39;t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil

      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      BEARDED Devil
      Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.
      A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skln, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.

      The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes are constricted in its coils and eaten alive.
      A behir&#39;s monstrous form resembles a combination of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on its underside.
      CAVERN PREDATORS. Behirs lair in places inaccessible to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a behir ambush. A behir&#39;s dozen legs allow it to scramble through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and slithering like a snake.
      Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders in its lair might overlook it.
      FOES OF THE DRAGONS. In times long forgotten, giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind.
      A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir&#39;s lair, the behir , is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if tlie dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behjr backdown, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.

    <description>
      One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.
      A beholder&#39;s spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.
      XENOPHOBIC ISOLATIONISTS. Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.
      The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others&#39; stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.
      EYE TYRANT. Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master&#39;s behalf.
      ALIEN LAIRS. Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder&#39;s lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.
      As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder&#39;s lair reflect the creature&#39;s arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.

      A BEHOLDER&#39;s LAIR

      A beholder&#39;s central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).

      LAIR ACTIONS
      When fighting inside it&#45; lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#45; A 50-foot square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#45; Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder&#39;s choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
      &#45; An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder&#39;s choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.

      The beholder can&#39;t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      A region containing a beholder&#39;s lair is warped by the creature&#39;s&#39;unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#45; Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder&#39;s lair sometimes feel as if they&#39;re being watched when they aren&#39;t.
      &#45; When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mi1e of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren&#39;t on anyone&#39;s person.

      If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

    <action>
      <name>Eye Rays</name>
      <text>The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:</text>
      <text>1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</text>
      <text>2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target&#39;s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can&#39;t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
      <text>6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray&#39;s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder&#39;s next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</text>
      <text>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn&#39;t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>
      <text>7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>
      <text>8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
      <text>If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>
      <text>10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Antimagic Cone</name>
      <text>The beholder&#39;s central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone.

    <trait>
      <name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
      <text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLACK DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most evil-tempered --and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.
      With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon&#39;s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon&#39;s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon&#39;s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.
      When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.

      Brutal and Cruel.
      All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.
      A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.

      Foes and Servants.
      Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.
      Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master&#39;s domain.
      A black dragon&#39;s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon&#39;s lair.
      Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon&#39;s hunger.

      Wealth of the Ancients.
      Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.

      A BLACK DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon&#39;s lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills,,watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
      &#8226; A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&#39;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#39;t illuminate it. If any of the effect&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary black dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
      &#8226; Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over ld10 days.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLUE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert&#39;s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
      A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
      A blue dragon&#39;s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

      Vain and Deadly.
      A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
      A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm&#39;s reach as it waits to attack again.

      Desert Predators.
      Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon&#39;s eye.
      When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

      Overlords and Minions.
      Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
      A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

      Hoarders of Gems.
      Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
      A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

      A BLUE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
      Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon&#39;s first line of defense.
      A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions&#45; along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC l5 constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      &#8226; Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#39;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
      &#8226; Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#39;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (&#45; 5).
      &#8226; Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#39;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.

      If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      BONE Devil
      Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so.
      A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRASS DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.
      A brass dragon&#39;s head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling&#39;s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon&#39;s scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.

      Boldly Talkative
      A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a·brass dragon&#39;s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon&#39;s thirst for small talk is slaked.
      A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.

      Prized Treasures
      Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.
      Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon&#39;s hoard.

      A BRASS DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      A brass dragon&#39;s desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary brass dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.
      &#8226; Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#39;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
      &#8226; Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#39;s presence and location.

      If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.

Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can&#39;t be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can&#39;t be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature&#39;s body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it&#39;s a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRONZE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.
      A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon&#39;s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling&#39;s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon&#39;s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.

      Dragons of the Coast
      Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship&#39;s captain for the item.

      War Machines
      Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use. When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.

      Well-Organized Wealth
      Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies&#39; means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.

      A BRONZE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.
      &#8226; Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1dl0 days.

    <description>
      Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.
      GOBLINOIDS. Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.
      FOLLOWERS OF HRUGGEK. Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek&#39;s side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.
      VENAL AMBUSHERS. Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

      FOLLOWERS OF HRUGGEK. Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek&#39;s side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.
      VENAL AMBUSHERS. Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

      A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also called a "land shark," it lives only to feed. Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack with no regard for superior numbers or strength.
      UNDERGROUND HUNTERS. Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.
      WANDERING MONSTER. A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.
      A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.
      All creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food&#45; even other predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male&#39;s death and consumption.
      ARCANE CREATION. Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard&#39;s experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.

      Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frogheaded amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.
      Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.
      FOUL ARISTOCRACY. Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader&#45; a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors&#39; favor.
      A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it&#39;s more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods.are reduced to filthy tatters throug.h abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.
      UNRULY DIPLOMACY. Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.
      Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size&#45; and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.
      AMPHIBIAN ALLIES. Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.
      Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs&#39; ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.

      A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage.
      BORN TO BE BAD. Cambions grow into ruthless adults whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it.
      PAWNS OF THE MIGHTY. A cambion forced to serve its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.
      SPAWN OFGRAZ&#39;ZT. The demon lord Graz&#39;zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, sixfingered hands, and unearthly beauty.

      Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.
      CARRION EATERS. A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries.
      A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don&#39;t think to look up.
      PATIENT PREDATORS. Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them.
      When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.

    <description>
      Reclusive wanderers and omen-readers of the wild, centaurs avoid conflict but fight fiercely when pressed. They roam the vast wilderness, keeping far from borders, laws, and the company of other creatures.
      WILDERNESS NOMADS. Centaur tribes range across lands with mild to hot climates, where a centaur requires only light furs or oiled skins to deal with inclement weather. They are hunter-gatherers and rarely build shelters or even use tents.
      Centaur migrations span continents and take decades to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread the same path for generations. These long-ranging patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter settlements of other creatures built along their traditional routes.
      RELUCTANT SETTLERS. A centaur that can&#39;t keep pace with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe might take up residence among other races. Frontier settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur residents. Many such communities owe their survival to the insight and acumen of a centaur.
      Despite their reclusive nature, centaurs trade with elves and with the caravans of other benevolent humanoids they meet during their wanderings. A trader might save the life of a wounded or an elderly centaur unfit for long travel, escorting it to a settlement where it can peacefully live out the rest of its days.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      CHAIN DEVIL
      This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.
      Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      CHASME
      This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable crossing of humanoid and fly.  A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls and ceilings.  A droning sound precedes the approch of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack.
      The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as interrogators or taskmasters.  A chasme lives to dole ot torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords.  Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of reprisal.

      Chimeras were created after mortals summoned Demogorgon to the world. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded it, transformed them into horrific, multi-headed monstrosities. This act gave rise to the first chimeras.
      Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera serves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to the Material Plane. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large goat, the forequarters of a lion, and the leathery wings of a dragon, along with the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise its victims, swooping down from the sky arid engulfing prey with its fiery breath before landing.
      CONFLICTED CREATURE. A chimera combines the worst aspects of its three parts. Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death.
      These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns.
      When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.
      SERVANT OF EVIL. Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts. If offered food and treasure, a chimera might spare a traveler. A villain can lure a chimera into service by keeping it well fed and its treasure hoard well stocked.

      Survivors of the ancient aboleth empire, chuuls are crustaceans the aboleths modified and endowed with sentience. They follow the ingrained directives of their creators, as they have done since the dawn of time.
      PRIMEVAL RELICS. In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.
      Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths&#39; command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths&#39; empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.
      TIRELESS GUARDIANS. Chuul still guard the ruins of the ancient aboleth empire. They linger in silent observance of eons-old commands. Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.
      Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.
      WAITING SERVANTS. Although the aboleths&#39; ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles. Such chuuls redirect their compulsions to the service of the aboleths&#39; sinister purposes.

      Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator&#39;s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.
      To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.

      Elemental Spirit in Material Form
      The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem&#39;s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.
      After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem&#39;s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem&#39;s creator.

      Ageless Guardians
      Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.
      A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.

      Blind Obedience
      When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can&#39;t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.
      A golem can&#39;t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can&#39;t be reasoned with or tricked with words.

      Constructed Nature
      A golem doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      CLAY GOLEM
      ----------------------------------------
      Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller than most human-sized creatures. It is human shaped, but its proportions are off. Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. If the golem is damaged, the elemental spirit bound into it can break free. Such a golem runs amok, smashing everything around it until it is destroyed or completely repaired.

      Cloakers earned their names for the resemblance they bear to dark leathery cloaks. Lurking in remote dungeons and caves, these stealthy predators wait to slay lone or injured prey stumbling through the darkness.
      CAMOUFLAGED LURKERS. Like a stingray, a cloaker&#39;s body is composed of cartilage and muscle. With its tail and fins unfurled, it flies through darkness and lurks among the shadows of caverns the same way a stingray glides through water and hides on the ocean floor. Parallel rows of round, black eyes pots run along its back like buttons, and the ivory-colored claws on its cowl resemble bone clasps.
      When a cloaker unfurls and moves to attack, it reveals its pale underside and makes its true nature evident. Red eyes glow above rows of sharp teeth, and a long pendulous tail whips behind it.
      OPPORTUNISTIC PREDATORS. When hunting, cloakers glide through the shadows at a safe distance behind groups of other creatures traversing the Underdark. They follow parties of humanoids to prey on the wounded after a battle, or pursue herds of Underdark beasts, attacking the sick, the weak, or the straggling.
      Cloakers strike quickly and consume their meals as swiftly as possible, enveloping and devouring their victims. While it feeds, a cloaker uses its swift, whiplike tail for defense, although it rarely takes a stand against dangerous foes or groups of creatures. As an added defense, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves.
      HAUNTING MOAN. Cloakers&#39; thoughts are alien to other life-forms, and they communicate with one another through subsonic moans inaudible to most creatures. At h-gher intensities, a cloaker&#39;s haunting moan becomes audible, evoking sensations of doom and dread in creatures that hear it.
      CLOAKER CONCLAVES. Cloakers prefer isolation, but they sometimes convene with other cloakers for defense or to exchange information about new dangers, suitable hunting grounds, or developments that might affect their habitats. When this convergence is compiete, the cloakers separate again.

If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target&#39;s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.</text>

      <text>The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn&#39;t in bright light.

      <text>Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      THE 0RDNING
      ----------------------------------------
      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      CLOUD GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Cloud giants live extravagant lives high above the world, showing little concern for the plights of other races except as amusement. They are muscular with light skin and have hair of silver or blue.

      High and Mighty
      Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However, they can seldom do so quickly.
      Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs. Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants&#39; lost empires.
      Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.

      Affluent Princes
      Although cloud giants are lower in the ordning than storm giants, the reclusive storm giants rarely engage with the rest of giantkind. As a result, many cloud giants see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant races. They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants&#39; amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence.
      On their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there, along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons. From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottagesized produce and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.
      As humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants&#39; gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.

      Children of the Trickster
      The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Meinnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silvertongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.

      Wealth and Power
      A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants. However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant&#39;s household.
      Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings&#39; ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.

    <description>The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs&#45; things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice&#39;s beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury.</description>

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      COPPER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite , their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.
      A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon&#39;s scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon&#39;s pupils fade with age, and .the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

      Good Hosts
      A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous .story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn&#39;t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.
      Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

      Cautious and Crafty
      When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.
      A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.

      A COPPER DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary copper dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Magic carvings of the dragon&#39;s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#39;t divulge its whereabouts.
      &#8226; Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.

      If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.

      Couatls are benevolent serpentine beings of great intellect and insight. Their brilliantly colored wings and gentle manner speak to their celestial origins.
      DIVINE CARETAKERS. Couatls were created as guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of the divine mandates given to these beings are long since fulfilled or failed. However, a number of couatls still watch over ancient power, await fulfillment of prophecy, or safeguard the heirs of creatures they once guided and protected. Regardless of a couatl&#39;s task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.
      TRUTH TELLERS. A couatl can&#39;t lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.
      ANCIENT AND FEW. A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise.
      If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.
      The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The . parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.

      <text>In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

      Crawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.
      MAGICAL ORIGINS. Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer&#39;s spirit already manifests as another undead creature, if the murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long passed on to another plane, the ritual fails.
      The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works best with a hand recently severed from a murderer. To this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or make bargains with assassins and torturers.
      CREATOR&#39;S CONTROL. A crawling claw can&#39;t be turned, nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight to mentally command its every action. If the crawling claw&#39;s creator doesn&#39;t command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability.
      Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can&#39;t be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.
      MALIGN INTELLGENCE. A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw&#39;s torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.
      LIVING CLAWS. If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer&#39;s soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.
      Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer. However, killing the murderer has no effect on the crawling claw.
      UNDEAD NATURE. A crawling claw doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      Cyclopes are one-eyed giants that eke out a meager existence in wild lands. Isolationists by nature, they avoid contact with other races and try to drive away strangers in their territory.
      NONRELIGIOUS. Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to any deities. They see little benefit in prayer and dislike ritual, which they perceive as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops that gains direct benefit from some site of divine power, or which is threatened by a supernatural force or creature, will pay homage as long as the benefit or threat remains.
      UNSOPHISTICATED. Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.
      A cyclops lairs within a day&#39;s journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other.
      Cyclopes don&#39;t use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.
      UNWISE. Cyclopes aren&#39;t great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes.
      Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a "god" is a mere mortal.

      Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.
      Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.

      Creatures of the Elements
      A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.
      A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie&#39;s form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don&#39;t mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.
      When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.

      Rule or Be Ruled
      Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie&#39;s power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie&#39;s ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.
      In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.

      Decadent Nobility
      Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination. Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn&#39;t beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie&#39;s will and risk the consequences.

      The Power of Worship
      Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mew ling of religious devotees tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful slaves.
      Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they, are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms&#45; even whole contintents or worlds&#45; bow down before them.

      DAO
      ----------------------------------------
      Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from precious gems and rare metals, and when they fly, their lower bodies become columns of swirling sand. A dao isn&#39;t happy unless it is the envy of other dao.

      All That Glitters
      The dao dwell in complexes of twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns on the Elemental Plane of Earth. These mazeworks are continually expanding as the dao delve into and reshape the rock around them. Dao care nothing for the poverty or misfortune of others. A dao might grind powdered gems and gold dust over its food to heighten the experience of eating, devouring its wealth as mortals consume a precious spice.

      Lords of the Earth
      A dao never assists a mortal unless the genie has something to gain, preferably treasure. Among the genies, dao are on speaking and trading terms with the efreet, but they have nothing but scorn for djinn and marids. Other races native to the Elemental Plane of Earth avoid the dao, which are always seeking new slaves to mine the mazeworks of their floating earth islands.

      Proud Slavers
      The dao trade for the finest slaves that money can buy, forcing them to work in dangerous subterranean realms that rumble with earthquakes. As much as they enjoy enslaving others, the dao hate being enslaved. Powerful wizards have been known to lure dao to the Material Plane and trap them in the confines of magic gemstones or iron flasks. Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.

      <text>At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, stone shape</text>
      <text>3/day each: passwall, move earth, tongues</text>
      <text>1/day each: conjure elemental (earth elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, phantasmal killer, plane shift, wall of stone</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Sure-Footed</name>
      <text>The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Variant: Genie Powers</name>
      <text>Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.</text>
      <text />
      <text>Disguises.</text>
      <text>Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
      <text>Wishes.</text>
      <text>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn&#39;t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can&#39;t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature&#39;s existence.</text>
      <text>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature&#39;s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie&#39;s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish&#39;s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie&#39;s benefit.</text>

    <description>
      A darkmantle clings to cavern ceilings, remaining perfectly still as it waits for creatures to pass beneath it. From a distance, it can pass itself off as a stalactite or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceiling and unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it engulfs and crushes its prey.
      Darkmantles are found throughout the Underdark, but they are equally common on the Shadowfell. Thriving in that dark realm, they fill an ecological niche similar to bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent creatures of the Shadowfell sometimes train darkmantles as guardians or companions.

      <text>While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle&#39;s speed also becomes 0, it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.</text>
      <text>A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.</text>

    <description>
      When a paladin that falls from gFace dies without seeking atonement, dark powers can transform the once-mortal knight into a hateful undead creature. A death knight is a skeletal warrior clad in fearsome plate armor. Beneath its helmet, one can see the knight&#39;s skull with malevolent pinpoints of light burning in its eye sockets.
      ELDRITCH POWER. The death knight retains the ability to cast divine spells. However, no death knight can use its magic to heal. A death knight also attracts and commands lesser undead, although death knights that serve powerful fiends might have fiendish followers instead. Death knights often use warhorse skeletons and nightmares as mounts.
      IMMORTAL UNTIL REDEEMED. A death knight can arise anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when it atones for a life of wickedness or finds redemption can it finally escape its undead purgatory and truly perish.

    <description>
      On rare occasions, a beholder&#39;s sleeping mind drifts to places beyond its normal madness, imagining a reality in which it exists beyond death. When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is fueled by the power of undeath.
      A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and glare in all directions.
      DEATHLY DESPOT. As they did when they were beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other creatures. Moreover, a beholder&#39;s ability to quash magical energy with its central eye gives way to a more sinister power in a death tyrant, which can transform former slaves and enemies into undead servants.
      Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and discarded as needed. They stand guard at the entrances to the death tyrant&#39;s lair or guard its treasure vaults.
      Acting as bait for traps or as combat fodder, zombies keep powerful enemies distracted while the death tyrant moves into position and prepares to destroy them.
      ARMIES OF THE DEAD. A death tyrant that embraces undeath becomes an engine of destruction. Driven by a hunger for power and security, it advances against humanoid settlements, using its eye rays to destroy every creature it encounters, then building an army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the population of a city in weeks, then set its unde-d eye on wider conquest. As each settlement falls, the death tyrant&#39;s zombie forces build to overwhelming numbers.
      UNDEAD NATURE. A death tyrant doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      A DEATH TYRANT&#39;s LAIR
      When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death tyrant can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#45; An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and tentacles. To creatures other than the death tyrant, that area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#45; Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Any creature, including one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
      &#45; A spectral eye opens in the air at a point within 50 feet of the tyrant. One random eye ray of the tyrant shoots from that eye, which is considered to be an ethereal source, at a target of the tyrant&#39;s choice. The eye then closes and disappears.
      The death tyrant can&#39;t repeat an effect until all three have been used, and it can&#39;t use the same effect on consecutive rounds.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      A region containing a death tyrant&#39;s lair is warped by the creature&#39;s unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#45; Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant&#39;s lair sometimes feel as if they&#39;re being watched even when they aren&#39;t.
      &#45; When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the tyrant&#39;s lair, roll a d20 for that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is subjected to one random eye Â· ray of the tyrant.
      If the death tyrant dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

    <action>
      <name>Eye Rays</name>
      <text>The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:</text>
      <text>1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the death tyrant harms the creature.</text>
      <text>2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target&#39;s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can&#39;t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
      <text>6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray&#39;s telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant&#39;s next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.</text>
      <text>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn&#39;t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>
      <text>7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>
      <text>8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
      <text>If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>
      <text>10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</text>
    </action>
    <trait>
      <name>Negative Energy Cone</name>
      <text>The death tyrant&#39;s central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.</text>
      <text>Any creature in that area can&#39;t regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant&#39;s command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn&#39;t been completely destroyed.</text>

      Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, live far below the world&#39;s surface in twisting warrens and sculpted caverns. They survive by virtue of their stealth, cleverness, and tenacity. Their gray skin a llows them to blend in with surrounding stonework. They are also surprisingly heavy and strong for their size. An average adult weighs 100 to 120 pounds and stands 3 feet tall.
      A typical svirfneblin enclave contains several hundred deep gnomes and is strongly fortified. Secret tunnels lead to and from the settlement, and the deep gnomes use these as evacuation routes when the enclave comes under attack.

      Established Gender Roles
      Male svirfneblin are bald, while females have stringy gray hair. Traditionally, females run the enclaves while males scour the outskirts in search of enemies and deposits of precious gemstones.

      Gemstone Harvesters
      Svirfneblin cherish fine gemstones, especially rubies, which they harvest from mines deep in the Underdark. The hunt for gems often brings them into conflict with beholders, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, and mind flayers. Of all their natural enemies, deep gnomes fear and despise the murderous, demonworshiping drow the most.

      Earth Friends
      Deep gnomes are often encountered in the company of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Some svirfneblin can summon such creatures. Earth creatures guard svirfneblin settlements, especially xorn enticed to service with the promise of gems to feed on.

    <description>
      The immortality granted to a lich lasts only as long as it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull remains. This "demilich" contains only a fragment of the lich&#39;s malevolent life force&#45; just enough so that if it is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume a wraithlike form. The skull then emits a terrifying howl that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and returns to the empty peace of its existence.
      Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming undead. However, time can erode the lich&#39;s reason and memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient tomb and forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane energy it wielded as a lich. However, even as a mere skull it remains a deadly and vexing enemy.
      ENDURING EXISTENCE. Even after a lich is reduced to a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its phylactery is intact, the demilich can&#39;t be permanently destroyed. Its skull reforms after 1d10 days, restoring the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim its former power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing so restores the demilich to lich form, reconstituting its undead body.
      UNDEAD NATURE. A demilich doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep. So great is a demilich&#39;s will to survive that it always has the maximum number of hit points for its Hit Dice, instead of average hit points.

      A DEMILICH&#39;s LAIR
      A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and traps. At the heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich&#39;s skull and the dust from its other bones.
      In its crypt, a demilich has access to lair actions and additional uses for its legendary actions. Its whole lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a challenge rating of 20 (24,500 XP).

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich rolls a d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row.
      &#45; The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each creature on the floor of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      &#45; The demilich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. An antimagic field fills the space of the target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#45; The demilich targets any number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. No target can regain hit points until initiative count 20 on the next round.

      LAIR TRAITS
      A demilich&#39;s tomb might have any or all of the following effects in place:
      &#45; The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb&#39;s area, the creature takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.
      &#45; Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and ag!linst features that turn undead.
      &#45; The tomb is warded against the magical travel of creatures the demilich hasn&#39;t authorized. Such creatures can&#39;t teleport into or out of the tomb&#39;s area or use planar travel to enter or leave it. Effects that allow teleportation or planar travel work within the tomb as long as they aren&#39;t used to leave or enter the tomb&#39;s area.

      If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of 10 days.

    <description>
      Devas are angels that act as divine messengers or agents to the Material Plane, the Shadowfell, and the Feywild and that can assume a form appropriate to the realm they are sent to.
      Legend tells of angels that take mortal form for years, lending aid, hope, and courage to good hearted folk. A deva can take any shape, although it prefers to appear to mortals as an innocuous humanoid or animal. When circumstances require that it cast off its guise, a deva is a beautiful humanoid-like creature with silvery skin. Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its shoulder blades.

      ANGELS
      An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god&#39;s agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.

      SHARDS OF THE DIVINE. Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight.
      Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels&#39; dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good.
      An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel&#39;s task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.

      FALLEN ANGELS. An angel&#39;s moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.
      Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.

      IMMORTAL NATURE. An angel doesn&#39;t require food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>
      This monstrous predator takes its name from its ability to displace light so that it appears to be several feet away from its actual location. A displacer beast resembles a sleek great cat covered in blue-black fur. However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders, both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A displacer beast&#39;s eyes glow with an awful malevolence that persists even in death.

      Unseelie Origins
      Displacer beasts roamed the twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn&#39;t take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.

      Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs attack each other on sight.

      Love of the Kill
      Displacer beasts kill not just for food but also for sport. They target prey even when not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without distraction.

      Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.

      Prized Guards and Pets
      Intelligent evil creatures favor displacer beasts as pets, but a displacer beast enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a bodyguard for a prominent individual.

    <description>
      Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.
      Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.

      Creatures of the Elements
      A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.
      A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie&#39;s form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don&#39;t mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.
      When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.

      Rule or Be Ruled
      Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie&#39;s power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie&#39;s ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.
      In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.

      Decadent Nobility
      Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination. Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn&#39;t beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie&#39;s will and risk the consequences.

      The Power of Worship
      Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mew ling of religious devotees tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful slaves.
      Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they, are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms&#45; even whole contintents or worlds&#45; bow down before them.

      DJINNI
      ----------------------------------------
      Proud, sensuous genies from the Elemental Plane of Air, the djinn are attractive, tall, well-muscled humanoids with blue skin and dark eyes. They dress in airy, shimmering silks, designed as much for comfort as to flaunt their musculature.

      Airy Aesthetes
      Djinn rule floating islands o clouds tuff covered with enormous pavilions, or topped with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and gardens. Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and beautiful music.
      Djinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.

      Masters of the Wind
      Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.

      Accepting Servitors
      The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the g(1nies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they never enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with them reluctantly.
      A mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinni resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly vengeance can amend.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
      <text>Wishes.</text>
      <text>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn&#39;t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can&#39;t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature&#39;s existence.</text>
      <text>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature&#39;s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie&#39;s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish&#39;s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie&#39;s benefit.</text>

      Doppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take on the appearance of other humanoids, throwing off pursuit or luring victims to their doom with misdirection an.d disguise. Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.

      Stealing Secrets.
      A doppelganger&#39;s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn&#39;t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature&#39;s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature&#39;s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim&#39;s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.

      Hedonistic Swindlers.
      Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim&#39;s riches.

      Changelings.
      Doppelgangers are too lazy or self­ interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother&#39;s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.

    <description>
      Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.
      A dragon turtle&#39;s rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble light dancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves.

      Dragons of the Deep
      Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair. Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.

      Mercenary Monsters
      A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.

      Elemental Might
      Dragon turtles sometimes find their way through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Plane of Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts.

    <description>
      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      DRETCH
      Dretches are among the weakest of demons &#45; repulsive, self-loathing creatures doomed to spend eternity in a state of perpetual discontent.  Their low intelligence makes dretches unsuitable for anything but the simplest tasks.  However, what they lack in potential, they make up for in sheer malice.  Dretches mill about in mobs, vociing their displeasure as an unsettling din of hoots, snarls, and grunts.

      When a drow shows great promise, Lolth summons it to the Demonweb Pits for a test of faith and strength. Those that pass the test rise higher in the Spider Queen&#39;s favor. Those that fail are transformed into driders&#45; a horrid hybrid of a drow and a giant spider that serves as a living reminder of Lolth&#39;s power. Only drow can be turned into driders, and the power to create these creatures resides with Lolth alone.

      Scarred for Life
      Drow transformed into driders return to the Material Plane as twisted and debased creatures. Driven by madness, they disappear into the Underdark to become hermits and hunters, either wandering alone or leading packs of giant spiders.
      On rare occasion, a drider returns to the fringes of drow society despite its curse, most often to fulfill some longstanding vow or vendetta from its former life. Drow fear and shun the driders, holding them in lower esteem than slaves. However, they tolerate the presence of these creatures as living representatives of Lolth&#39;s will, and a reminder of the fate that awaits all who fail the Spider Queen.

      VARIANT: DRIDER SPELLCASTING
      ----------------------------------------
      Driders that were once drow spellcasters might retain their ability to cast spells. Such driders typically have a higher spellcasting ability (l5 or 16) than other driders. Further, the drider gains the Spell casting trait. A drider that was a drow divine spellcaster, therefore, could have a Wisdom of 16 (+3) and a Spellcasting trait as follows.

      Spellcasting
      The drider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks) . The drider has the following spells prepared from the cleric spell list:
      Cantrips (at will): poison spray, thaumaturgy
      1st level (4 slots): bane, detect magic, sanctuary
      2nd level (3 slots): hold person, silence
      3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, dispel magic
      4th level (2 slots): divination ,freedom of movement

    <description>
      Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

      Children of Lolth
      The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

      Creatures of Darkness
      The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

      Underdark Cities
      The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably reslient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.

      A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

      Drow Magic
      Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

      Arms and Armor
      Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

      Cutthroat Politics
      Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.
      Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house&#39;s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

      Matriarchal Rule
      Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.
      In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can&#39;t be priests, nor can they rule a house.

      Poison Predilection
      Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

    <description>
      Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

      Children of Lolth
      The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

      Creatures of Darkness
      The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

      Underdark Cities
      The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably reslient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.

      A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

      Drow Magic
      Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

      Arms and Armor
      Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

      Cutthroat Politics
      Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.
      Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house&#39;s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

      Matriarchal Rule
      Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.
      In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can&#39;t be priests, nor can they rule a house.

      Poison Predilection
      Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

      DROW ELITE WARRIOR
      ----------------------------------------
      Drow elite warriors defend their houses and their superiors against all enemies, although they specialize in fighting dwarves, gnomes, and elves (including other drow). They frequently raid surface settlements under cover of night, returning to the Underdark with prisoners and spoils in tow before dawn.
      Elite warriors can be male or female

Female drow with a natural affinity fot the arcane arts may also become drow mages, although they are much less common.

      DROW PRIESTESS OF LOLTH
      ----------------------------------------
      Female drow with blood ties to a noble house are molded and trained from birth to become priestesses of Lolth. The Spider Queen doesn&#39;t allow male drow to hold such positions.
      Such priestesses execute the will 0f the Spider Queen, and as a result, they wield tremendous power and influence in drow society. The matron mothers who rule the drow houses are the most powerful of Lolth&#39;s priestesses, but they must constantly balance their devotion to the Spider Queen with their devotion to their families.

    <description>
      Travelers entering a forest might catch a glimpse of a feminine form flitting through the trees. Warm laughter hangs on the air, drawing those who hear it deeper into the emerald shadows.

      Treebound
      Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love is forbidden.
      A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world. As long as the tree remains healthy and unharmed, the dryad stays forever youthful and alluring. If the tree is harmed, she suffers. If the tree is ever destroyed, the dryad descends into madness.

      Reclusive Fey
      Dryads act as guardians of their woodland demesnes. Shy and reclusive, they watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty of a stranger might investigate more closely, perhaps even try to lure the individual away to be charmed.
      Dryads work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to druids that share the dryads&#39; devotion to the woods they call home.

      Woodland Magic
      Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile liumanoids with her enchantments, turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.

    <description>
      The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.
      Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.

      Slaves to Slavers
      The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind ftayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.
      Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.

      Tough as Stone
      Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar&#39;s mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.

      Born of Darkness
      The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can&#39;t fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.
      Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar&#39;s vision is compromised by sunlight.

      Infernal Master
      Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.

    <description>
      The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.
      Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.

      Slaves to Slavers
      The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind ftayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.
      Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.

      Tough as Stone
      Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar&#39;s mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.

      Born of Darkness
      The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can&#39;t fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.
      Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar&#39;s vision is compromised by sunlight.

      Infernal Master
      Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.

    <description>
      The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.
      Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.

      Slaves to Slavers
      The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind ftayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.
      Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.

      Tough as Stone
      Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar&#39;s mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.

      Born of Darkness
      The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can&#39;t fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.
      Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar&#39;s vision is compromised by sunlight.

      Infernal Master
      Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.

      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      EARTH ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      An earth elemental plods forward like a walking hill, club-like arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides. Its head and body consist of dirt and stone, occasionally set with chunks of metal, gems, and bright minerals.
      Earth elementals glide through rock and earth as though they were liquid. Earthbound creatures have much to fear from an earth elemental, since the elemental can pinpoint the precise location of any foe that stands on solid ground in its vicinity.

      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      EARTH ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      An earth elemental plods forward like a walking hill, club-like arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides. Its head and body consist of dirt and stone, occasionally set with chunks of metal, gems, and bright minerals.
      Earth elementals glide through rock and earth as though they were liquid. Earthbound creatures have much to fear from an earth elemental, since the elemental can pinpoint the precise location of any foe that stands on solid ground in its vicinity.

      Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.
      Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.

      Creatures of the Elements
      A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.
      A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie&#39;s form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don&#39;t mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.
      When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.

      Rule or Be Ruled
      Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie&#39;s power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie&#39;s ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.
      In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.

      Decadent Nobility
      Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination. Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn&#39;t beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie&#39;s will and risk the consequences.

      The Power of Worship
      Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mew ling of religious devotees tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful slaves.
      Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they, are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms&#45; even whole contintents or worlds&#45; bow down before them.

      EFREETI
      ----------------------------------------
      Hulking genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, the efreet are masters of flame, immune to fire and able to create it on a whim. Fine silk caftans and damask robes drape their magma-red or coal-black skin, and they bedeck themselves in brass and gold torcs, chains, and rings, all glittering with jewels. When an efreeti flies, its lower body transforms into a column of smoke and embers.

      Haughty and Cruel
      The efreet are deceptive, cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness. They despise being forced into servitude and are relentless in pursuit of vengeance against creatures that have wronged them. Efreet don&#39;t see themselves in this light, naturally, and regard their race as fair and orderly, even as they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest.

      Spiteful Slavers
      Efreet view all other creatures as enemies or potential serfs. They raid the Material Plane and the elemental planes for slaves, which they capture and bring back to their homes on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as oppressive tyrants, promoting only the cruelest among their slaves. Those overseers are given whips to help keep the rank-and-file slaves in line.

      Planar Raiders
      Most efreet reside on the Elemental Plane of Fire, either in great domed fortresses of black glass and basalt surrounded by churning lakes of fire, or in the fabled City of Brass. Additionally, efreet military outposts thronging with their minions and slaves can be found scattered throughout the planes.
      On the Material Plane, efreet dwell in fiery regions such as volcanoes and the burning expanses of the  world&#39;s deserts. Their love of the desert brings them into conflict with the djinn that ride the desert whirlwinds, and with the earthbound dao. Efreet utterly despise marids, with whom they have maintained a passionate conflict throughout the history of both races.

      <text>Disguises.</text>
      <text>Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
      <text>Wishes.</text>
      <text>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn&#39;t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can&#39;t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature&#39;s existence.</text>
      <text>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature&#39;s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie&#39;s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish&#39;s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie&#39;s benefit.</text>

    <description>
      Empyreans are the celestial children of the gods of the Upper Planes. They are universally beautiful, statuesque, and self-assured.

      Manifest Emotion
      An empyrean can experience deity-like fits of serenity or rage. It can affect the environment a round it by its mood. When an empyrean is unhappy, the clouds might cry tears of salt water, the wildflowers in surrounding meadows might wilt, dead fish might wash ashore in lakes or rivers, or a nearby forest might lose the leaves from its trees. When an empyrean is jubilant, sunlight follows it everywhere, small animals frolic in its footsteps, and birds fill the sky with their pleasing songs.

      Evil Empyreans
      A few empyreans have turned to evil after venturing to the Lower Planes and becoming corrupted, or as the result of being cursed by evil gods. An evil empyrean can&#39;t survive long on the Upper Planes and usually retreats to the Material Plane, where it can rule over a kingdom of mortals as an indomitable tyrant.

      Immortal Titans
      Empyreans don&#39;t age but can be  slain. Because few empyreans can imagine their own demise, they fight fearlessly when drawn into battle, refusing to believe that the end is upon them even when standing at death&#39;s door. When an empyrean dies, its spirit returns to its home plane. There, one of the fallen empyrean&#39;s parents resurrects the emprean unless he or she has a good reason not to.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      ERINYES
      The most beautiful and striking of all lesser and greater devils, the erinyes are fierce and disciplined warriors. Sweeping down from the skies, they bring swift death to creatures that have wronged their masters or defied the edicts of Asmodeus. The erinyes appear as male or female humanoids with statuesque builds and large feathery wings. Most wear stylized armor and horned helms, and carry exquisite swords and bows. A few also use ropes of entanglement to ensnare powerful foes.
      Legends tell that the first erinyes were angels that fell from the Upper Planes because of temptation or misdeed.  Erinyes are always willing to take advantage of being mistaken for celestials in the missions of conquer and corruption.

    <description>
      Ettercaps are humanoid spiders that tend, feed, and watch over spiders the way a shepherd oversees a flock of sheep. They lair deep in remote forests.
      Fine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap&#39;s abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.

      Quiet Killers
      When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap&#39;s territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.

      Sylvan Despoilers
      Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps&#39; victims.

      Enemies of the Fey
      Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad&#39;s tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.

      VARIANT: WEB GARROTE
      Some ettercaps like to strangle prey using garrotes fashioned from webbing. An ettercap so armed gains the following action option, which it uses in place of its claws.

      Web Garrote
      Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which the ettercap has advantage on the attack roll. Hit: 4 (1 d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target can&#39;t breathe, and the ettercap has advantage on attack rolls against it.

    <description>
      An ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude characterists of an orc. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.

      Dual Personality
      The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other&#39;s slights.
      When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.

      Solitary Lives
      As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce. An ettin&#39;s twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match. Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins&#39; mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her sixmonth pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.

      Two Heads are Better than One
      When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.

      Orcish Ties
      In ancient dialects of Common, the word "ettin" translates as "ugly giant." Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.
      Whatever the truth of the ettins&#39; origin, orcs treat them as distant cousins, and ore tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin is n&#39;t particularly loyal to its ore handlers, but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.

    <description>
      A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment only if it is attacked.

      Invisible Tricksters
      The only warning of a faerie dragon&#39;s presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey."

      Friendly and Bright
      A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon&#39;s draconic nature by offering it "treasure" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.

      The Colors of Age
      A faerie dragon&#39;s scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.

      Dragon Color        Age Range
      Red                 5 years or less
      Organge             6 &#45; 10 years

      A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment only if it is attacked.

      Invisible Tricksters
      The only warning of a faerie dragon&#39;s presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey."

      Friendly and Bright
      A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon&#39;s draconic nature by offering it "treasure" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.

      The Colors of Age
      A faerie dragon&#39;s scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.

    <description>
      A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment only if it is attacked.

      Invisible Tricksters
      The only warning of a faerie dragon&#39;s presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey."

      Friendly and Bright
      A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon&#39;s draconic nature by offering it "treasure" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.

      The Colors of Age
      A faerie dragon&#39;s scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.

      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      FIRE ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      A faint humanoid shape threads through the core of this wild, moving flame. A fire elemental is a force of capricious devastation. Wherever it moves, it sets. its surroundings ablaze, turning the world to ash, smoke, and cinders. Water can halt its destructive progress, causing the fire elemental to shrink back, hissing and smoking in pain and rage.

      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      FIRE ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      A faint humanoid shape threads through the core of this wild, moving flame. A fire elemental is a force of capricious devastation. Wherever it moves, it sets. its surroundings ablaze, turning the world to ash, smoke, and cinders. Water can halt its destructive progress, causing the fire elemental to shrink back, hissing and smoking in pain and rage.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      THE 0RDNING
      ----------------------------------------
      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      FIRE GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Master crafters and organized warriors, fire giants dwell among volcanoes, lava floes, and rocky mountains. They are ruthless militaristic brutes whose mastery of metalwork is legendary.

      Fire Forged
      Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants&#39; forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants&#39; stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.
      Fire giants shun cold as much as their cousins the frost giants hate heat. They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and furs to stay warm.

      Martial Experts
      From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants&#39; fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash. The fire giants&#39; songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths&#39; hammers throughout their smoky halls.
      Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.

      Feudal Lords
      Humanoids conquered in war become serfs to the fire giants. The serfs work the farms and fields on the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, raising livestock and harvesting fields whose bounty is almost entirely tithed to the fire giant kings. Fire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than writing or arithmetic. Though most fire giants place little worth on such frivolousness they sometimes keep slaves at court who. are versed in such skills. Serfs not destined for court or the fields (especially dwarves) are taken to the fire giants&#39; mountainous realms to mine ore and gemstones from deep within the earth.
      Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the slaves that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work for long. Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the safety of their slaves than on smelting and working the bounty those slaves produce.

      Skilled Artisans
      Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists. They excel at smelting and smith work, as they do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality of their artistry shows even in their implements of destruction and their weapons of war.
      Fire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and most potent siege weapons. They experiment with alloys to create the hardest armor, then forge the swords that can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and brains in equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend to be the smartest and strongest of their kind.

    <description>
      Blazing green flames and mad, echoing laughter follow a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne. When the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts the intruders with fiery rays from its eyes and dreadful spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory.
      Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete, green flames erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly transformation.

      Legacy of Life
      A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components it can no longer employ.

      Eternally Bound
      Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull carries out the directives given to it when it was created, and it interprets those commands to the letter. A flameskull&#39;s master must craft its instructions with care to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly.

      Wreathed in Flame
      The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those  flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.

      Eldritch Rejuvenation
      A flameskull&#39;s shattered fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy water or subjected to a dispel magic or remove curse spell. If it can no longer fulfill its intended purpose, the re-formed flameskull is beholden to no one and becomes autonomous.

      Undead Nature
      A flameskull doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>
      Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator&#39;s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.
      To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.

      Elemental Spirit in Material Form
      The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem&#39;s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.
      After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem&#39;s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem&#39;s creator.

      Ageless Guardians
      Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.
      A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.

      Blind Obedience
      When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can&#39;t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.
      A golem can&#39;t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can&#39;t be reasoned with or tricked with words.

      Constructed Nature
      A golem doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      FLESH GOLEM
      ----------------------------------------
      A flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem&#39;s muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the golem&#39;s skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.
      A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn&#39;t an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator&#39;s will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.

      <name>Berserk</name>
      <text>Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</text>
      <text>The golem&#39;s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

    <description>
      The mysterious flumphs drift through the Underdark, propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting its moods in its color. Soft pink means it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger.

      Intelligent and Wise
      Flumphs communicate telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs are sentient beings of great intelligence and wisdom, possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy, mathematics, and countless other subjects.
      Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures. If a creature&#39;s thoughts suggest goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When facing creatures that exude evil, a flumph flees.

      Psionic Siphons
      Flumphs feed by siphoning mental energy from psionic creatures, and they can be found lurking near communities of mind flayers, aboleths, githyanki, and githzerai. As passive parasites, they take only the mental energy they need, and most creatures feel no loss or discomfort from such feeding.
      Consuming psionic energy reveals the thoughts and emotions of the creatures on which the flumphs feed. Since so many of those creatures are evil, flumphs are often subjected to thoughts, emotions, and hungers that sicken their pure nature. When flumphs encounter goodhearted adventurers, they eagerly share the dark secrets they have learned in the hopes of casting down their evil sources of energy, even if doing so rn.eans they must seek out new sources of nourishment.

      Flumph Society
      Flumphs live in complex and organized groups called cloisters, within which each flumph has a place and purpose. These harmonious groupings have no need for leaders, since all flumphs contribute in their own way.

      A flying sword dances through the air, fighting with the confidejlce of a warrior that can&#39;t be injured. Swords are the most common weapons animated with magic. Axes, clubs, daggers, maces, spears, and even selfloading crossbows are also known to exist in animated object form. .

      ANIMATED OBJECTS
      Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.

      CONSTRUCTED NATURE. An animated object doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
      The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

      The most hideous and wicked of all giantkind are the godles&#39;s fomohans, whose deformed bodies reflect their vile demeanors. Some have facial features randomly distributed around their misshapen, warty heads. Others have limbs of grossly different sizes and shapes, or emit terrible howls each time they draw breath through misshapen mouths. Their wretched appearance rarely evokes sympathy, however, for the fomorians brought their doom upon themselves with the evil that rules their hearts and minds.

      Fey Curse
      The elves remember when the fomorians were among the most handsome of races, possessed of brilliant minds and unrivaled magical ability. That physical perfection did not extend to their hearts, however, as a lust for magic and power consumed them. The fomorians sought to conquer the Feywild and enslave its inhabitants, claiming those creatures&#39; magic for themselves. When the fey united to defend their realm, the fomorians fought them and were subjected to a terrible curse.
      One by one, the giants fell as their bodies were warped to reflect the evil in their hearts. Stripped of their grace and magical power, the wretched horrors fled from the light, delving deep beneath the world to nurse their hatred. Cursing their fate, they have ever after plotted vengeance against the fey that wronged them.

      Giants of the Underdark
      The fomorians dwell in eerily beautiful caverns in the Underdark, rarely venturing to the surface. Their lairs feature abundant access to water, fish, and mushroom forests, as well as to the creatures whose slave labor keeps the fomorians fed. When those slaves can no longer toil, they are slain and devoured. Wickedness and depravity are the cornerstones of fomorian society, in which the strongest and cruelest giants rule. Fomorians mark their territories with the corpses of their enemies, painting their cavern walls with blood or stitching together limbs and body parts to make mockeries of the creatures they have killed.

      Ruined Flesh, Evil Minds
      The deformities visited on the fomorians prevent them from hurling rocks like their giant kin, or wearing anything more than scraps of cloth. However, the grotesque positioning of their eyes, noses, and ears gives fomorians keen perceptive abilities, making it hard to surprise or ambush them. The greed and evil of the fomorians lies at the heart of their degeneration and fall, and continues to plague them. Fomorians make alliances with other creatures when it suits them, but they are disloyal by nature and betray their allies on a whim.

      Curse of the Evil Eye
      Fomorians can pass their curse onto others using a power called the evil eye&#45; a last vestige of the giants&#39; once-remarkable spellcasting ability. A creature cursed by a fomorian&#39;s evil eye is magically twisted and deformed, gaining a glimpse into the pain and malice that has consumed this evil race.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      THE 0RDNING
      ----------------------------------------
      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      FROST GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond civilization, frost giants are fierce, hardy warriors that survive on the spoils of their raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies.

      Hearts of Ice
      Frost giants are creatures of ice arid snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their flesh is as blue as glacial ice.
      Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don&#39;t grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don&#39;t cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.

      Reavers of the Storm
      The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants&#39; path.
      Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.

      Rulers by Might
      Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant&#39;s place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.
      When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes ava lanches on the snowy mountainsides.

      Make War, Not Goods
      Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon&#39;s teeth or claws.

      The galeb duhr is a boulder-like creature with stumpy appendages that act as arms and legs. It has the ability to animate the rocks and boulders around it, and is thus usually encountered in rocky terrain.
      Powerful magic allows a spellcaster to summon a galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The galeb duhr is imbued with greater intelligence than most elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to communicate with creatures entering its guarded area.

      Stone Guardian
      A galeb duhr doesn&#39;t age or require sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr might be created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard&#39;s tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly still for years at a time.
      A galeb duhr is permanently bound to the Material Plane, so that when it dies, it doesn&#39;t return to the Plane of Earth. It has an excellent memory and is more than happy to share information regarding its environment with creatures it doesn&#39;t regard as threats.

      Stone Connection
      A galeb duhr can become one with the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. When it needs to move close to those intruders, it presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a furious pace.

    <description>
      Theinanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.

      Animate Stone
      Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.

      Deadly Reputation
      Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.

      Cruel Servants
      Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master&#39;s home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage. Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.

      Elemental Nature
      A gargoyle doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      SHARDS OF ELEMENTAL EVIL
      ----------------------------------------
      As Ogremoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with the essence of the elemental prince, growing over long years into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles.
      Ogremoch doesn&#39;t create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogremoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like their creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every opportunity to destroy such creatures.

      On their home plane, gargoyles carve out earth motes that Ogremoch hurtles into Aaqa, the domain of the aarakocra and the benevolent Wind Dukes the bird folk serve in the Elemental Plane of Air.

      Ghouls roam the night in packs, driven by an insatiable hunger for humanoid flesh.

      Devourers of Flesh
      Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can&#39;t feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul&#39;s undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.

      Abyssal Origins
      Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord&#39;s other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls&#39; paralytic touch.

      Ghasts
      Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls to follow its commands.

    <description>
      A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in its life.

      Unfinished Business
      A ghost yearns to complete some unresolved task from its life. It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.
      The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.

      Ghostly Manifestations
      Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.

      Undead Nature
      A ghost doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 _ 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.</text>

      <text>One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn&#39;t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can&#39;t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target&#39;s statistics, but doesn&#39;t gain access to the target&#39;s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</text>
      <text>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

    <description>
      Ghouls roam the night in packs, driven by an insatiable hunger for humanoid flesh.

      Devourers of Flesh
      Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can&#39;t feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul&#39;s undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.

      Abyssal Origins
      Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord&#39;s other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls&#39; paralytic touch.

      Ghasts
      Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls to follow its commands.

    <description>
      Of all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims. Driven to insanity by the destruction of their bodies and absorption into the mouther, those victims gibber incoherent madness, forced to consume everything in reach.

      Amoeboid Form
      The gibbering mouther&#39;s body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.

      Mouths of Madness
      When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.

      All-Consuming
      Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.
      A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim&#39;s body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster&#39;s next meal.

      The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people&#45; two cultures that utterly despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.
      After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle. Zerthimon challenged Gith&#39;s motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day.
      Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant time.

      GITHYANKI
      ----------------------------------------
      The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons&#45; the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.

      Astral Raiders
      The githyanki despise all other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their strongholds in the Astral Plane to the farflung corners of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and again.

      Followers of Gith
      In their own language, githyanki means "followers of Gith." Under the guidance of Gith, the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn enemies of their race. When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced by her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade worship of all beings except herself. Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.

      Silver Swords
      In ancient times, gith knights created special weapons to combat their mind Hayer masters. These silver swords channel the force of the wielder&#39;s will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can&#39;t become a knight until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade into  existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.
      In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for their people.

      Red Dragon Riders
      In the uprising against the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Gith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen&#39;s red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don&#39;t consider the githyanki their enemies.

      Outposts in the Mortal Realm
      Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don&#39;t age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young. Doubling as military academies, these creches train young githyanki to harness their psychic and combat abilities. When a githyanki grows to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the Astral Plane.

Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.

      Silver Swords
      In ancient times, gith knights created special weapons to combat their mind Hayer masters. These silver swords channel the force of the wielder&#39;s will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can&#39;t become a knight until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade into  existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.
      In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for their people.

      Red Dragon Riders
      In the uprising against the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Gith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen&#39;s red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don&#39;t consider the githyanki their enemies.

      Outposts in the Mortal Realm
      Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don&#39;t age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young. Doubling as military academies, these creches train young githyanki to harness their psychic and combat abilities. When a githyanki grows to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the Astral Plane.

      The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people&#45; two cultures that utterly despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.
      After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle. Zerthimon challenged Gith&#39;s motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day.
      Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant time.

      GITHZERAI
      ----------------------------------------
      Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo.

      Psionic Adepts
      The progenitors of the githzerai adapted to&#45; and were transformed by&#45; the psychic environment imposed on them by their illithid overlords. Under the teachings of Zerthimon, who called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions of Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy on creating physical and psychic barriers to protect them from attack, psychic or otherwise. Fighting is personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze and incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to physical punishment.

      Order amid Chaos
      The githzerai willingly dwell in the heart of utter chaos in Limbo&#45; a twisting, mercurial plane prone to manipulation and subjugation by githzerai minds strong enough to master it. Limbo is a maelstrom of primal matter and energy, its terrain a storm of rock and earth swept up in torrents of murky liquid, buffeted by strong winds, blasted by fire, and chilled by crushing walls of ice.
      The forces of Limbo react to sentience, however. Using the power of their minds, the githzerai tame the plane&#39;s chaotic elements, causing them to settle into fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and sanctuaries within the maelstrom.
      Githzerai fortress-monasteries stand resolute against the chaos that surrounds them, virtually impervious to the turmoil of their s urroundings, because the githzerai will it. Each monastery is overseen by monks that impose a strict schedule of chants, meals, martial arts training, and devotions according to their own philosophy. Behind their psionically fortified walls, the githzerai embrace thought, learning, psionic power, order, and discipline above all other things. The social hierarchy of the githzerai is based on merit, and those githzerai who are the wisest teachers and the most skilled at physical and mental combat become leaders. The githzerai revere great heroes and teachers of the past, emulating those figures&#39; virtues in their everyday lives.


      Disciples of Zerthimon
      Githzerai revere Zerthimon, the founder of their race. Although Gith won their people&#39;s freedom, Zerthimon saw her as unfit to lead. He believed that her warmongering would soon make her a tyrant no better than the mind flayers.
      Skilled githzerai monks that best exemplify the teachings and principles of Zerthimon are called zerths. These powerful and disciplined monks can shift their bodies from one plane to another using only the power of their minds.

      Beyond Limbo
      Though githzerai rarely deal with the realms beyond Limbo, advanced monks of other races sometimes seek out a githzerai monastery and attempt to gain admittance as students. More rarely, a githzerai master establishes a hidden monastery on the Material Plane to train young githzerai or to spread the philosophy and teachings of Zerthimon.
      As disciplined as they are, the githzerai have never forgotten their long imprisonment by the mind flayers. As a special devotion, they organize a rrakkma&#45; an illithid hunting party-to other planes, not returning to their monasteries until they slay at least as many illithids as there are hunters in the party.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      GLABREZU
      A glberzu takes great pleasure in destorying mortals through temptation and these creatures are among the few demons to offer their service to creatures foolish enough to summon them.
      Although glabrezus are devastating in combat, they prefer to tempt victims into ruin, using power or wealth as a lure.  Engaging in guile, trickery, and evil bargains, a glabrezu hoards riches that it uses to fulfill promises to shortsighted summoners and weak-willed mortals.  However, if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a glabrezu has the strength to fight and win.

      Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

      Demonic Origin
      The origin of the gnolls traces back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord&#39;s kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.

      Nomadic Destroyers
      Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.
      Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don&#39;t make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.

      Thirst for Blood
      No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can&#39;t be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls&#39; frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.

      GNOLL PACK LORD
      ----------------------------------------
      The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll pack&#39;s spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It ornaments its body with brutal piercings and grotesque trophies, dyeing its fur with demonic sigils, hoping Yeenoghu will make it invulnerable.

      GNOLL FANG OF YEENOGHU
      ----------------------------------------
      Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu&#39;s favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang ofYeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang&#39;s slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a fullgrown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of hyenas in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.

      ----------------------------------------
      Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu&#39;s favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang ofYeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang&#39;s slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a fullgrown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of hyenas in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.

    <description>
      Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

      Demonic Origin
      The origin of the gnolls traces back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord&#39;s kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.

      Nomadic Destroyers
      Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.
      Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don&#39;t make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.

      Thirst for Blood
      No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can&#39;t be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls&#39; frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.

      GNOLL PACK LORD
      ----------------------------------------
      The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll pack&#39;s spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It ornaments its body with brutal piercings and grotesque trophies, dyeing its fur with demonic sigils, hoping Yeenoghu will make it invulnerable.

      GNOLL FANG OF YEENOGHU
      ----------------------------------------
      Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu&#39;s favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang ofYeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang&#39;s slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a fullgrown adult gnoll.

      Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large&#45; sometimes overwhelming&#45; numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

      Goblinoids
      Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

      Malicious Glee
      Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can&#39;t help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

      Leaders and Followers
      Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe&#39;s survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs .

      Challenging Lairs
      Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are a lso riddled with narrow tunnels a nd bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can&#39;t navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, a llowing them to flee or to circle around and s urprise their enemies. Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders. Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

      Worshipers of Maglubiyet
      Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet&#39;s army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One&#39;s eternal tyranny even more than death.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GOLD DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.
      A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon&#39;s sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.

      Devourer of Wealth
      Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn&#39;t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren&#39;t bribes.

      Reserved Shapeshifters
      Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.
      Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.

      Master Hoarders
      A gold dragon keeps its hoard ina well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.

      A GOLD DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon&#39;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary gold dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.
      &#8226; Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The mist doesn&#39;t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil cveatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.
      &#8226; Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.

      If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.

      Few creatures that encounter a gorgon live to tell about it. Its body is covered in iron plates, and its nostrils fume with green vapor.

      Horrific Structure
      A gorgon&#39;s iron plates range from steely black to gleaming silver, but this natural armor in no way hinders its movement or mobility. The oils of its body lubricate the armor. A sick or inactive gorgon gathers rust like fungus or mange. When a rusty gorgon moves, its plates squeal as they rub together.

      Monstrous Predator
      When a gorgon spots potential prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and sends its sprawling, then tramples it to death with its cruel hooves. Faced with multiple foes, the gorgon exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures it touches by turning them to stone. When it grows hungry, it smashes its petrified prey to rubble and uses its strong teeth to grind the stone into a powder that provides nourishment. The crisscrossing network of trampled trails and splintered trees that surrounds a gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its shattered foes.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      GORISTRO
      The goristro resembles a fiendish minotaur towering more than twenty feet tall.  When controlled by a demon lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and prized pets.  Goristros posses preternatural cunning when navigating labyrinthine passages and shifting corridors, pursuing foes in a terrifying hunt.
      A hulking goristro sometimes bears a palanquin, carring smaller demons on its broad shoulders, much like an elephant carries riders on its back.

      <text>Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GREEN DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
      A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
      A wyrmling green dragon&#39;s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
      A green dragon&#39;s legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

      Capricious Hunters
      A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
      Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can he&#39;lp it further its ambitions.
      A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures&#39; activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

      Manipulative Schemers
      A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
      When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

      Conflict and Corruption
      Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades&#45; for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
      Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions&#39; minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions&#39; tortured dreams.

      Living Treasures
      A green dragon&#39;s favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

      A GREEN DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon&#39;s wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature&#39;s poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches, the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
      At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#39;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary green dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement.  A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.
      Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#39;s path.
      &#8226; Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair serve as the dragon&#39;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

      If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.

      Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

      Faces of Evil
      Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.
      All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity. claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

      Monstrous Motherhood
      Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother&#39;s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.
      Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

      Dark Bargains
      Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.
      Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dearespecially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

      A Foul Nature
      Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, s uppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.
      This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag&#39;s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant&#39;s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

      Dark Sorority
      Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don&#39;t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag&#39;s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag&#39;s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags&#45; as long as the oath isn&#39;t given with the fingers crossed.
      Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags&#39; rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

      Dark Lairs
      Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag&#39;s lair reflects the creature&#39;s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

      HAG COVENS
      ----------------------------------------
      When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
      A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

      Shared Spellcasting
      While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&#39;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:
      1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
      2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
      3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
      4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
      5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
      6th level (1 slot): eye bite

      For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier.

      Hag Eye
      A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
      A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

      GREEN HAG
      ----------------------------------------
      The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.

      Obsession with Tragedy
      Green hags revel in the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for whole nations.

      Covens
      A green hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 5 (1,800 XP).

      A grell resembles a bulbous floating brain with a wide, sharp beak. Its ten long tentacles are made of hundreds of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in tough fibrous hide. Sharp barbs line the tip each tentacle and inject paralytic venom. The grell can partially retract its barbs into its tentacles to handle or manipulate objects it doesn&#39;t want to pierce or tear.
      Grells have no eyes and floats by means of a sort of levitation. They have keen hearing, however, and their skin is s ensitive to vibrations and electrical fields, allowing them to detect the presence of creatures and objects in their immediate vicinity. The creature&#39;s ability to manipulate electricity to sense and move also allow it to absorb lightning without harm.
      Although solitary by nature, grells sometimes gather in small groups called covens.

      Floating Ambushers
      A grell prefers to ambush lone creatures or stragglers, hovering silently near the ceiling of a passage or cavern until a suitable target passes below, whereupon it descends quickly and wraps its tentacles around its prey. It then floats away to its lair with the paralyzed creature in its clutches.

      Alien Devourers
      Grell are alien predators that group other creatures into three categories: edibles, inedibles, and Great Eaters (those rare creatures that might prey on a grell). Grells have no compunction about attacking creatures they classify as edible, including humanoids. They tend to avoid bigger creatures that they have little hope of carrying away.
      A grell will sometimes allow adventurers to wage war on the other monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon complex it calls home, staying out of the adventurers&#39; way as they dispose of larger threats while waiting for
      the right time to strike.

      <text>The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). If the target is Medium or smaller, it is also restrained until this grapple ends.

      The wormlike grick waits unseen, blending in with the rock of the caves and caverns it haunts. Only when prey comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal its hungry, snapping beak.

      Passive Predators
      Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling a round stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fall en creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.

      Roving Ambushers
      Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes a round their lairs. When prey is scarce in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges.
      A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.

      Spoils of Slaughter
      Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs. Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then claim the wealth of the foul creatures&#39; victims.

      A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.

      Spoils of Slaughter
      Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs. Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then claim the wealth of the foul creatures&#39; victims.

      Griffons are ferocious avian carnivores with the muscular bodies of lions and the head, forelegs, and wings of eagles. When they attack, griffons are as swift and deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion&#39;s savage might and grace.

      Horse Eaters
      Griffons hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey.
      Those riding or herding horses dread the griffon&#39;s piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse&#39;s rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey.  Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking griffon.

      Sky Dweliers
      Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food supply has been exhausted.
      Aggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffon&#39;s lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.

      Trained Mounts
      A griffon raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon&#39;s legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.
      Once trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.

    <description>
      The degenerate subterranean grimlocks were once human, but their worship of the mind flayers over generations of prowling the Underdark transformed them into blind, monstrous cannibals long ago.

      Debased Cultists
      The empire of the mind flayers once spread across many worlds, enslaving countless races. Among those were human cultures whose high priests the mind flayers subverted using their insidious powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually turned the faiths of their followers toward the illithids, which they worshiped as blasphemous deities.
      Over time, the rituals of these enslaved humans created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain eating of the mind flayers as a holy sacrament. The illithids commanded their worshipers to abduct other sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims&#39; brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the lifeless bodies to the cultists.

      Blind Hunters
      When the rule of the mind flayers crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their enemies, the same creatures that had once been their victims. The cults fled into the Underdark domains of their illithid gods. Over generations in that lightless realm, the cultists learned to rely on their other senses for survival. In time, their eyes withered away and eyelids sealed, leaving only covered eye sockets behind.
      A grimlock&#39;s ears prick up at the faintest footfall or whisper echoing down stone passageways. It can speak in tones too low for most other humanoids to hear. The odors of sweat, flesh, and blood awaken its hunger, and it can track by such scents like a bloodhound. To enhance their senses, grim locks leave trails of blood, piles of dung, or the viscera of slain prey in places far from their lairs. When intruders pass through those areas, they carry the foul scents with them, wa rning the grimlocks of their approach.
      For most creatures, blindness is an enormous hindrance. For a grimlock with its other heightened senses, sightlessness is a boon. A grimlock isn&#39;t fooled by visual illusions or misperceptions. It is fearless as it stalks prey.

      Endless War
      Grimlocks still venerate the mind flayers, serving them whenever possible. Grimlocks also recall the war in which they were driven underground. To them, it has never ended. They continue to return to the surface world to abduct captives for their illithid masters.

    <description>
      When a dragon in polymorphed form mates with another creature, the union sometimes produces halfdragon offspring. A creature might also transform into a half-dragon as a result of a mad wizard&#39;s spell or a ritual bath in dragon&#39;s blood. In all these cases, the result is a creature that combines the essence of a dragon with the form of its original race. Regardless of their origins, all half-dragons have similar features and appearance, gaining special senses, resistance to destructive energy, and a breath weapon.

      Draconic Nature
      Half-dragons are incapable of having natural born offspring. Those that wish to propagate must find other ways to do so, almost always involving magic. By way of compensation, halfdragons are blessed with long life. Barring unforeseen misfortune, a typical half-dragon&#39;s life expectancy is twice that of its nondraconic line, so that a half-dragon human might live more than a century and a half.
      Half-dragons inherit personality traits common to their draconic heritage, so that half-gold dragons are often shy and secretive, while half-copper dragons are impish and playful. Half-green dragons are deceitful, while half-white dragons are often dim-witted brutes.
      These traits are tempered by a half-dragon&#39;s other lineage, but greed, arrogance, and paranoia are qualities that even good-aligned half-dragons often possess.

      HALF-DRAGON TEMPLATE
      ----------------------------------------
      A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. When a creature becomes a half-dragon, it retains all its statistics except as noted below.

      Senses
      The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.

      Resistances
      The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color.
      Color                  Damage Resistance
      Black or copper        Acid
      Blue or bronze         Lightning
      Brass, gold, or red    Fire
      Green                  Poison
      Silver or white        Cold

      Languages
      The half-dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any other languages it knows.

      New Action:
      Breath Weapon
      The half-dragon has the breath weapon of its dragon half. The half-dragon&#39;s size determines how this action functions.

      Size                  Breath Weapon
      Large or smaller      As a wyrmling
      Huge                  As a young dragon
      Gargantuan            As an adult dragon

      SAMPLE HALF-DRAGON

      Here the half-dragon template has been applied to a human veteran to create a half-red dragon veteran. Splint armor has been replaced with plate.

    <description>
      Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume. A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human.
      Its wicked talons and bone club make it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.

      Divine Curse
      Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird&#39;s song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.
      Though the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven ot despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf&#39;s cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.
      When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf&#39;s spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.

      Harpy Song
      To hear a harpy&#39;s song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy&#39;s wrath.

      Sadistic Cowards
      Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.
      When they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the "music" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.

      Gruesome Collectors
      Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy&#39;s lair is usually hidden in remote ruins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul piles of offal.

      Monstrous, fire-breathing fiends that take the form of powerful dogs, hell hounds are found on the battlefields of Acheron and throughout the Lower Planes. On the Material Plane, hell hounds are most commonly seen in service to devils, fire giants, and other evil creatures that use them as guard animals and companions.

      Burning Hunger
      Hell hounds hunt in packs, feeding on any creature that appears edible. They avoid potentially dangerous foes in favor of targeting the weakest prey with their savage bite and fiery breath, demonstrating a relentless determination as they pursue that prey to the bitter end.
      When hell hounds feed, the flesh they consume stokes the infernal fires that burn within them. When a hell hound dies, that fire consumes the creature&#39;s remains in a billowing eruption of smoke and blazing embers, leaving nothing behind but scorched tufts of black fur.

      Evil to the Core
      Hell hounds are smarter than mundane beasts, and their lawful nature makes them good at following orders. However, a hell hound&#39;s evil disposition means that the creature can&#39;t be trained to be anything other than a ruthless killer. If a hell hound isn&#39;t allowed to indulge its malevolent hunger, it quickly abandons or turns against its master.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      HEZROU
      Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demonic hordes of the Abyss.  Although physically powerful, they are weak minded and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful demons.  As hey press their attacks into the heart of an enem&#39;s forces, their foul stench can sicken even the toughiest foes.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      THE 0RDNING
      ----------------------------------------
      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      HILL GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.

      Primitive
      Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mudand-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.

      Bigger Means Better
      In a hill giant&#39;s world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.
      Hill giants don&#39;t realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe&#39;s chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.

      Voracious Eaters
      With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn&#39;t obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.
      Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.

      Stupid and Deadly
      The hill giants&#39; ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped.
      With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don&#39;t think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.
      In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another&#39;s sholders holding a giant-painted pumpkin head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.

      Raging Bullies
      A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.
      If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      HORNED DEVIL
      Horned devils are lazy to the point of belligerence and reluctant to put themselves in harm&#39;s way. Moreover, they hate and fear any creature stronger than themselves. When they are sufficiently provoked or antagonized, the fury of these fiends can be terrifying.
      A malebranche stands as tall as an ogre and is
      sheathed in scales as tough as iron. The flying infantry of the hellish legions, horned devils follow orders to the letter. Their huge wings and sweeping horns create an intimidating presence as they drop from the sky and strike with deadly forks and lashing tails.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      ICE DEVIL
      Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and resentment. Coveting the power of their pit fiend superiors, ice devils work ceaselessly toward promotion, slaughtering the enemies of the Nine Hells and claiming as many souls as they can for their archdevil masters.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      IMP
      Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. An imp will proudly serve an evil master of any kind, but it can&#39;t be relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency.
      An imp can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with  its poison stinger.

    <description>
      Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator&#39;s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.
      To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.

      Elemental Spirit in Material Form
      The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem&#39;s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.
      After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem&#39;s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem&#39;s creator.

      Ageless Guardians
      Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.
      A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.

      Blind Obedience
      When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can&#39;t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.
      A golem can&#39;t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can&#39;t be reasoned with or tricked with words.

      Constructed Nature
      A golem doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      IRON GOLEM
      ----------------------------------------
      The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem&#39;s shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.
      An iron golem&#39;s body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLUE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert&#39;s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
      A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
      A blue dragon&#39;s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

      Vain and Deadly.
      A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
      A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm&#39;s reach as it waits to attack again.

      Desert Predators.
      Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon&#39;s eye.
      When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

      Overlords and Minions.
      Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
      A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

      Hoarders of Gems.
      Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
      A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

      A BLUE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
      Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon&#39;s first line of defense.
      A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions&#45; along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC l5 constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      &#8226; Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#39;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
      &#8226; Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#39;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (&#45; 5).
      &#8226; Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#39;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.

      If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

      <name>Weapon Invention</name>
      <text>The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:</text>
      <text />
      <text>1. Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.</text>
      <text />
      <text>2. Alchemist&#39;s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist&#39;s fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target&#39;s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</text>
      <text />
      <text>3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm&#39;s turns, there&#39;s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>
      <text />
      <text>4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.</text>
      <text />
      <text>5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.</text>
      <text />
      <text>6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
      <text />
      <text>7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can&#39;t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn&#39;t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can&#39;t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.</text>
      <text />
      <text>8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm&#39;s turns, there&#39;s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      LEMURE
      A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil and banished to the Nine Hells for eternity. The lowest type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures doomed to suffer torment until they are promoted to a higher form of devil, most commonly an imp.
      A lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent expression of anguish twists across its face, its feeble mouth babbling even though it can&#39;t speak.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      MANES
      Souls of evil creatures that descend to the Lower Planes are transformed into manes &#45; the lowest form of demonkind.  These wretched fiends attack any nondemon they see, and they are called to the Material Plane by those seeking to sow death and chaos.
      Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power o transform manes into undead monsters, most oftern ghouls and shadows.  Other demon lords feed on manes, destroying them utterly.  Otherwise, killing a manes causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that reforms into another manes after one day.

      Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.
      Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.

      Creatures of the Elements
      A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.
      A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie&#39;s form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don&#39;t mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.
      When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.

      Rule or Be Ruled
      Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie&#39;s power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie&#39;s ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.
      In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.

      Decadent Nobility
      Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination. Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn&#39;t beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie&#39;s will and risk the consequences.

      The Power of Worship
      Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mew ling of religious devotees tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful slaves.
      Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they, are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms&#45; even whole contintents or worlds&#45; bow down before them.

      MARID
      ----------------------------------------
      Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the groundhugging dao, and the fuming efreet.
      Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.

      Water Lords
      Water is a marid&#39;s native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.

      Marid Homes
      Marids are rare on the Material Plane. They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels float in the depths of the plane and contain opulent, airfilled chambers where slaves and guests reside.
      A marid doesn&#39;t expect much from its slaves, simply wanting to have them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and aren&#39;t above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.

      Egotistical Hierarchs
      All mar ids claim a title of nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the self-important marids.
      Marids treat all others-including other genies&#45; as inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.
      Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a creature that knows its place.

      Whimsical Storytellers
      Marids are champion taletellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren&#39;t always malicious in their deception, but embellishments suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.

Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
      <text>Wishes.</text>
      <text>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn&#39;t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can&#39;t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature&#39;s existence.</text>
      <text>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature&#39;s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie&#39;s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish&#39;s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie&#39;s benefit.</text>

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      MARILITH
      Terrible to behold, a marilith has the lower body of a great serpent and the upper troso of a humanoid female with six arms.
      Wielding a wicked blade in each of its six hands, a marilith is a devastating foe that few can match in battle.  These demons possess keen minds and a finely honed sense of tactics, and they are able to lead and unite other demons in common cause.  Mariliths are often encountered as captains at the head of a demonic horde, where they embrace any opportunity to rush headlong into battle.

      <name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
      <text>When a creature that can see the medusa&#39;s eyes starts its turn within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn&#39;t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can&#39;t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
      <text>If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</text>

    <description>
      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      NALFESHNEE
      The nalfeshnee is one of the most grotesque demons &#45; a corpulent mockery of ape and boar standing twice the height of a human, with feathered wings that seem  too small for its bloated body. These brutish features conceal a remarkable intelligence and cunning.
      Nalfeshnees are devastating in combat, using their wings to soar above the front ranks and reach vulnerable adversaries that can be dispatched with little effort From the thick of battle, they telepathically bellow commands to lesser demons, even as they inspire a sense of dread that forces their foes to scatter and run.
      Nalfeshnees feed on hatred and despair, but they crave humanoid flesh above all else. They keep their larders filled with humanoids abducted from the Material Plane, then eat those creatures alive during elaborate feasts. Thinking of themselves as refined and cultured, nalfeshnees employ stained and rusted cutlery when they dine.

If a creature&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee&#39;s Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.</text>

    <description>
      In the shadows of a forest, needle blights might be taken at a distance for shuffling, hunched humanoids. Up close, these creatures reveal themselves as horrid plants whose conifer-like needles grow across their bodies in quivering clumps. A needle blight lashes out with these needles or launches them as an aerial assault that can punch through armor and flesh.
      When needle blights detect a threat, they loose a pollen that the wind carries to other needle blights throughout the forest. Alerted to their foes&#39; location, needle blights converge from all sides to drench their roots in blood.

      BLIGHTS
      Awakened plants gifted with the powers of intelligence and mobility, blights plague lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.
      ROOTS OF THE GULTHIAS TREE. Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire&#39;s evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.
      DARK CONQUEST. Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or po-er, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.
      In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.
      CONTROLLED BY EVIL. Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree&#39;s control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor&#39;s old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.

    <description>
      Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

      Faces of Evil
      Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.
      All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity. claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

      Monstrous Motherhood
      Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother&#39;s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.
      Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

      Dark Bargains
      Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.
      Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dearespecially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

      A Foul Nature
      Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, s uppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.
      This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag&#39;s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant&#39;s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

      Dark Sorority
      Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don&#39;t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag&#39;s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag&#39;s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags&#45; as long as the oath isn&#39;t given with the fingers crossed.
      Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags&#39; rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

      Dark Lairs
      Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag&#39;s lair reflects the creature&#39;s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

      HAG COVENS
      ----------------------------------------
      When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
      A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

      Shared Spellcasting
      While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&#39;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:
      1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
      2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
      3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
      4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
      5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
      6th level (1 slot): eye bite

      For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier.

      Hag Eye
      A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
      A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

      NIGHT HAG
      ----------------------------------------
      Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous turn to villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness turned to hate, devotion to disregard, and generosity to selfishness. Night hags take perverse joy in corrupting mortals.
      Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but their foulness saw them exiled to Hades long ago, where they degenerated into fiends. The night hags have long since spread across the Lower Planes.

      Soulmongers
      While a humanoid sleeps, a night hag can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag&#39;s spectral form straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills her victim&#39;s head with doubts and fears, in the hope of tricking it into performing evil acts in the waking world.
      The hag continues her nightly visitations until the victim finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her victim to commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul in her soul bag (see the "Night Hag Items" sidebar) for transport to Hades.

      Covens
      A night hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 7 (2,900 XP).

      NIGHT HAG ITEMS
      ----------------------------------------
      A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.

      Heartstone
      This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

      Soul Bag
      When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag&#39;s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh . A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).

      <text>While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane.

If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target&#39;s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag&#39;s soul bag. The reduction to the target&#39;s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>

Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).</text>

      <name>Hag Coven</name>
      <text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
      <text>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&#39;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</text>
      <text />
      <text>&#45; 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</text>
      <text>&#45; 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</text>
      <text>&#45; 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</text>
      <text>&#45; 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</text>
      <text>&#45; 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</text>
      <text>&#45; 6th level (1 slot): eye bite</text>
      <text />
      <text>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
      <text>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      PIT FIEND
      The undisputed lords of most other devils, pit fiends attend the archdukes and archduchesses of the Nine Hells and carry out their wishes. These mighty devils are the generals of the Nine Hells, leading its infernal legions into battle.
      With an inflated sense of superiority and entitlement, pit fiends form a grotesque aristocracy in the infernal realm. These domineering and manipulative tyrants conspire to eliminate anything that stands between them and their desires, even as they negotiate the convoluted and dangerous politics of the Nine Hells.
      A pit fiend is a hulking monster with a whip-like tail and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a cloak. Armored scales cover its body, and its fanged maw drips a venom that can lay the mightiest mortal creatures low. Fearless in battle, a pit fiend takes on the most powerful foes in single combat, demonstrating its supremacy and an arrogance that prevents it from acknowledging any chance of defeat.

    <description>
      Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, presenting a tangible representation of their deities&#39; might. A planetar can call down rain to relieve a drought, or can loose an insect plague to devour crops. A planetar&#39;s celestial ears detect every falsehood, and its radiant eyes see through every deception.
      Planetars are muscular and hairless and have opalescent green skin and white-feathered wings. They tower over most humanoids, brandishing immense swords with grace. Sometimes sent to aid powerful mortals on important tasks for good, planetars are especially fond of missions that involve battling fiends.

      ANGELS
      An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god&#39;s agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.

      SHARDS OF THE DIVINE. Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight.
      Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels&#39; dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good.
      An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel&#39;s task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.

      FALLEN ANGELS. An angel&#39;s moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.
      Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.

      IMMORTAL NATURE. An angel doesn&#39;t require food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>
      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      PLESIOSAURUS
      ----------------------------------------
      A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact body is driven by powerful flippers. Predatory and aggressive, it attacks any creature it encounters. Its flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, letting it twist in any direction to deliver a powerful bite.

      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      PTERANODON
      ----------------------------------------
      These flying reptiles have wingspans of 15 to 20 feet and typically dive for small marine prey, though they are opportunists and will attack any creature that appears edible. A pteranodon has no teeth, instead using its sharp beak to stab prey too large to swallow with one gulp.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      QUASIT
      Quasits infest the Lower Planes. Physically weak, they keep to the shadows to plot mischief and wickedness. More powerful demons use quasits as spies and messengers when they aren&#39;t devouring them or pulling them apart to pass the time.
      A quasit can assume animal forms, but in its true form it looks like a 2-foot-tall green humanoid with a barbed tail and horns. The quasit has clawed fingers and toes, and these claws can deliver an irritating poison. It prefers to be invisible when it attacks.

At any time and for any reason, the quasit can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.</text>

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      RED DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
      The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that  metal burned blue by fire.
      The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

      Mountain Masters
      Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

      Arrogant Tyrants
      Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
      No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

      Status and Slaves
      Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
      When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn&#39;t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe&#39;s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

      Obsessive Collectors
      Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
      A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item&#39;s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can&#39;t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

      A RED DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
      With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.
      Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon&#39;s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser&#39;s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      &#8226; A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      &#8226; Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.


      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary red dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
      &#8226; Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

      If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1dl0 days.

    <description>
      Would-be thieves and careless heroes arrive at the doorsteps of an enemy&#39;s abode, eyes and ears alert for traps, only to end their quest prematurely as the rugs beneath their feet animate and smother them to death.
      A rug of smothering can be made in many different forms, from a finely woven carpet fit for a queen to a coarse mat in a peasant&#39;s hovel. Creatures with the ability to sense magic detect the rug&#39;s false magical aura.
      In some cases, a rug of smothering is disguised as a carpet of flying or another beneficial magic item. However, a character who stands or sits on the rug, or who attempts to utter a word of command, is quickly trapped as the rug of smothering rolls itself tightly around its victim.

      ANIMATED OBJECTS
      Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.

      CONSTRUCTED NATURE. An animated object doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
      The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

    <description>
      Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

      Faces of Evil
      Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.
      All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity. claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

      Monstrous Motherhood
      Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother&#39;s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.
      Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

      Dark Bargains
      Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.
      Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dearespecially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

      A Foul Nature
      Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, s uppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.
      This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag&#39;s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant&#39;s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

      Dark Sorority
      Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don&#39;t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag&#39;s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag&#39;s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags&#45; as long as the oath isn&#39;t given with the fingers crossed.
      Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags&#39; rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

      Dark Lairs
      Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag&#39;s lair reflects the creature&#39;s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

      HAG COVENS
      ----------------------------------------
      When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
      A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

      Shared Spellcasting
      While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&#39;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:
      1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
      2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
      3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
      4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
      5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
      6th level (1 slot): eye bite

      For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 +the hag&#39;s Intelligence modifier.

      Hag Eye
      A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
      A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&#39;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

      SEA HAG
      ----------------------------------------
      Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters. Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When confronted with something beautiful, the hag might simply attack it or deface it. If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.

      Ugly Inside and Out
      Sea hags are by far the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag&#39;s hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll&#39;s. Although a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.

      Covens
      A sea hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP).

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag&#39;s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.</text>
      <text>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag&#39;s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.</text>

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      SHADOW DEMON
      When a demon&#39;s body is destroyed but the fiend is prevented from reforming in the Abyss, its essence sometimes takes on a vague physical form. These shadow demons exist outside the normal abyssal hierarchy, since their creation results most often from mortal magic, not from transformation or promotion.
      Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim&#39;s fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim&#39;s mind.
      SHADOWY NATURE. A shadow demon doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      SILVER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.
      A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling&#39;s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.

      Dragons of Virtue
      Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one&#39;s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don&#39;t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

      Friends of the Small Races
      Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong frieqdships.
      Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.

      Respect for Humanity
      Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don&#39;t. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.

      Hoarding History
      Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.

      A SILVER DRAGON&#39;s LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (iosing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A blistering cold wind. blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1dl0) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary silver dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#39;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.
      &#8226; Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.

      A solar is godlike in its glory and power. On the battlefield, the solar&#39;s sword flies into the fray on its own, and a single arrow from a solar&#39;s bow can strike a target dead on contact. So great is a solar&#39;s celestial might that even demon princes shrink at its resonant commands.
      It is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that are known are stewards of specific deities. The others rest in a state of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good.

      ANGELS
      An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god&#39;s agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.

      SHARDS OF THE DIVINE. Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight.
      Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels&#39; dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good.
      An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel&#39;s task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.

      FALLEN ANGELS. An angel&#39;s moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.
      Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.

      IMMORTAL NATURE. An angel doesn&#39;t require food, drink, or sleep.

      <text>A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target&#39;s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target&#39;s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target&#39;s skin at the end of the target&#39;s next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss.

    <description>
      A spectator is a lesser beholder that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four beholder eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual&#39;s magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyes talks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.
      MAGICAL GUARDIANS. A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner&#39;s choice for 101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.
      GLIMMERS OF MADNESS. Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner. Like any beholder, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.
      FREED FROM SERVICE. When a spectator has fulfilled its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died. With the spectator&#39;s loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it dis-layed during its servitude flourish.

      DEVILS
      Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
      LORDS OF TYRANNY. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.
      Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
      OBEDIENCE AND AMBITION. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.
      At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
      DARK DEALERS AND SOUL MONGERS. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus&#39;s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.
      To own a creature&#39;s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fi endish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal&#39;s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

      THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.
      A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
      If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever&#45; a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
      ARCHDEVILS. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
      GREATER DEVILS. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
      LESSER DEVILS. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
      LEMURES. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
      PROMOTION AND DEMOTION. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil&#39;s memories passing intact from one form to the next.
      Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

      INFERNAL HIERARCHY
      1. lemure

      Lesser devils
      2. imp
      3. spined devil
      4. bearded devil
      5. barbed devil
      6. chain devil
      7. bone devil

      Greater devils
      8. horned devil
      9. erinyes
      10. ice devil
      11. pit fiend

      Archdevils
      12. duke or duchess
      13. archduke or archduchess

      Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.
      No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other&#39;s most powerful servants. Since all  devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.
      THE NINE HELLS
      The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

      SPINED DEVIL
      Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even fiends that despise a spined devil&#39;s weakness treat it with a modicum of respect.
      A spined devil&#39;s body and tail bristle with spines, and it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines burst into flame on impact.
      When not delivering messages or gathering intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness by mobbing together to overwhelm their foes. Though they crave promotion and power, spined devils are craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight goes against them.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      THE 0RDNING
      ----------------------------------------
      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      STONE GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Stone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a stern countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world.

      Inhabitants of a Stone World
      Secluded caves a re the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.
      In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants&#39; cave bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves.

      Carvers and Seers Among stone giants, artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills.
      Stone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe&#39;s best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as they work.

      Graceful Athletes
      Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants&#39; ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.

      Dreamers under Sky
      Stone giants view the world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in  the surface world the way humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world beneath the sky.
      Stone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe&#39;s outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters. When trespassers stray too far into the mountain territory of a stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such encounters spread tales of stone giant violence, never realizing how little those brutes dwelling in the unreal dreaming world resemble their quiet and artistic kin.

      Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator&#39;s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.
      To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.

      Elemental Spirit in Material Form
      The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem&#39;s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.
      After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem&#39;s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem&#39;s creator.

      Ageless Guardians
      Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.
      A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.

      Blind Obedience
      When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can&#39;t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.
      A golem can&#39;t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can&#39;t be reasoned with or tricked with words.

      Constructed Nature
      A golem doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      STONE GOLEM
      ----------------------------------------
      Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.
      Like other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.

In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.

      Each of the main giant races&#45; the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants&#45; are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.
      Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.
      At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.
      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      STORM GIANT
      ----------------------------------------
      Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places far removed from mortal civilization. Most have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes. Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep violet or blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple eyes. They are benevolent and wise unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect the fate of thousands.

      Distant Prophet-Kings
      Storm giants live in isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures. Some make their abodes in cloud-top castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the clouds. Some occupy palaces covered with algae and coral at the bottom of the ocean, or grim fortresses in undersea rifts.

      Detached Oracles
      Storm giants recall the glory of ancient giant empires forged by the god Annam. They seek to restore what was lost when those empires fell. They don&#39;t compete for status in the ordning but live out the centuries of their existence in contemplative seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean&#39;s depths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam&#39;s favor.
      Storm giants see the events of the world in a wide perspective. They can foretell the rise and fall of kings and empires, see the beginnings and ends of fortune and disaster, and find the patterns within seemingly unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giants learn of vast secrets previously unknown and troves of lore utterly forgotten.
      Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, and good and evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants have watched these events in the manner of mortal gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is pointless to intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly disclose certain secrets to benevolent beings that visit its remote domain with specific purpose. Such creatures must speak and act respectfully, however, for a storm giant roused to anger is a force of utter destruction.

      Solitary Lives
      Storm giants communicate infrequently with others of their kind. They do so usually to compare signs and omens or engage in a rare courtship. Storm giant parents stay together to raise a child to maturity, then return to the solitary isolation they cherish.
      Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as they would worship lesser gods, creating myths and stories around the giants&#39; exploits and vast knowledge. A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its conscience, however, and not by any culture&#39;s laws or codes of honor. As such, a storm giant that bends its mind toward greed or gains a taste for petty power can easily become a terrible threat.

      Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants&#39; feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.

      Old as Legend
      In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.
      Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants&#39; heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race&#39;s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.

      Regardless of a giant&#39;s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn&#39;t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.

      <text>	A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll. Each time the zombie loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.</text>
      <text>	If its head is severed, the zombie loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.</text>
      <text>	The zombie&#39;s speed is halved if it&#39;s missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from bonuses to speed.</text>

At the start of each of the target&#39;s turns, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target&#39;s next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.</text>

    <description>
      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      TRICERATOPS
      ----------------------------------------
      One of the most aggressive of the herbivorous dinosaurs, a triceratops has a skull that flares out to form a protective plate of bone. With its great horns and formidable speed, a triceratops gores and tramples would-be predators to death.

      Twig blights can root in soil, which they do when living prey are scarce. While rooted, they resemble woody shrubs. When it pulls its roots free of the ground to move, a twig blight&#39;s branches twist together to form a humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs.
      Twig blights seek out campsites and watering holes, rooting there to set up ambushes for potential victims coming to drink or rest. Huddled together in groups, twig blights blend in with an area&#39;s natural vegetation or with piles of debris or firewood.
      Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly susceptible to fire.

      BLIGHTS
      Awakened plants gifted with the powers of intelligence and mobility, blights plague lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.
      ROOTS OF THE GULTHIAS TREE. Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire&#39;s evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.
      DARK CONQUEST. Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or po-er, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.
      In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.
      CONTROLLED BY EVIL. Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree&#39;s control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor&#39;s old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.

      Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

      TYRANNOSAURUS REX
      ----------------------------------------
      This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, and there are few creatures it won&#39;t try to devour whole. While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that try to dart in to steal its meal.

Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target&#39;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&#39;s control.</text>

      <text>The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it.

The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&#39;t under the vampire&#39;s control, it takes the vampire&#39;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#39;s bit attack.</text>

      <text>While in bat form, the vampire can&#39;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged.

It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#39;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#39;t pass through water.

The target&#39;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&#39;s control.</text>

      <text>The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&#39;t under the vampire&#39;s control, it takes the vampire&#39;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#39;s bit attack.</text>
      <text>Each time the vampire or the vampire&#39;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

      <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>If the vampire isn&#39;t in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</text>
      <text>While in bat form, the vampire can&#39;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
      <text>While in mist form, the vampire can&#39;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#39;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#39;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

      <text>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&#39;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point.

    <description>
      Appearing as masses of slithering creepers, vine blights hide in undergrowth and wait for prey to draw near. By animating the plants around them, vine blights entangle and hinder their foes before attacking.
      Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech. Through its connection to the evil spirit of the Gulthias tree it serves, a vine blight speaks in a fractured version of its dead master&#39;s voice, taunting victims or bargaining with powerful foes.

      BLIGHTS
      Awakened plants gifted with the powers of intelligence and mobility, blights plague lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.
      ROOTS OF THE GULTHIAS TREE. Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire&#39;s evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.
      DARK CONQUEST. Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or po-er, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.
      In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.
      CONTROLLED BY EVIL. Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree&#39;s control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor&#39;s old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.

      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      VROCK
      Vrocks are dull-witted, capricious fiends that live only to create pain and carnage. A vrock resembles a giant hybrid of humanoid and vulture, its gnarled, bestial body and broad wings stinking of offal.
      Vrotks&#39; goblel humanoid flesh whenever they can, stunning potential prey with an ear-splitting shriek, then swooplng down to attack with beak and claw. Vrocks can shake their wings, releasing clouds of toxic spores.
      Coveting pretty things, vrocks turn against each other for the chance to lay claim to cheap jewelry or ornamental stones. Despite their love of treasure, vrocks are difficult to bribe, seeing no reason to bargain when they can simply take what they want from a would-be bargainer&#39;s corpse.

      Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

      Living Elements
      On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

      Conjured by Magic
      Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

      Bound and Shaped
      Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.
      The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can&#39;t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

      Elemental Nature
      An elemental doesn&#39;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      WATER ELEMENTAL
      ----------------------------------------
      A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures that stand against it, filling their mouths and lungs as easily as it smothers flame.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      WHITE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.
      A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.

      Primal and Vengeful
      White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.
      A white dragon a lso keeps the bodies of its greatest enerriies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon&#39;s lair as warnings to intruders.
      Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites.  White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.

      Lone Masters
      White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.

      White dragons can&#39;t abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon&#39;s wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.
      Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon&#39;s obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon&#39;s lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.

      Treasure Under Ice
      White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.
      Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon&#39;s lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon&#39;s breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon&#39;s great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon&#39;s main hoard.
      A white dragon&#39;s flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.

      A WHITE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.
      A legendary white dragon&#39;s innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon&#39;s presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.
      A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary white dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.
      &#8226; Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#39;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
      If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.

      If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.

    <description>
      Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil&#45; engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.
      SPAWN OF CHAOS. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

      CAPRICIOUS ELEVATION. Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon&#39;s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.
      A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.
      By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon&#39;s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

      ABYSSAL INVASIONS. Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.
      Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

      SIGNS OF CORRUPTION. Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

      ETERNAL EVIL. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can&#39;t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor.  It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.  The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the abyss and kill it there.

      PROTECTED ESSENCE. A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon&#39;s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.
      Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holdsÂ­ or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

      DEMONIC CULTS. Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord&#39;s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.

      DEMON SUMMONING. Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons, yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.
      Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another&#39;s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

      BOUND DEMONS. The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend&#39;s return to the Abyss.
      An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

      DEMONIC POSSESSION. No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.
      As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.

      YOCHLOL
      The yochlols are the Handmaidens of Lolth-extensions of the Spider Queen&#39;s will dedicated to acting as her spies, taskmasters, and agents of villainy. They attend their goddess in the Demonweb Pits, but Lolth sometimes dispatches yochlols to the Material Plane to guard her temples and to aid her most devout priestesses. Yochlols don&#39;t form outside Lolth&#39;s realm of the Demonweb, and they serve no demon lords except their queen.
      Outside the Abyss, a yochlol can assume the guise of a female drow or monstrous spider to conceal its demonic form. In its true form, the fiend appears as a pillar of yellow slime with a single malevolent eye. In its drow and true form, a yochlol&#39;s touch carries the same venomous touch as its spider form&#39;s bite.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLACK DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most evil-tempered --and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.
      With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon&#39;s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon&#39;s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon&#39;s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.
      When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.

      Brutal and Cruel.
      All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.
      A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.

      Foes and Servants.
      Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.
      Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master&#39;s domain.
      A black dragon&#39;s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon&#39;s lair.
      Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon&#39;s hunger.

      Wealth of the Ancients.
      Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.

      A BLACK DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon&#39;s lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills,,watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
      &#8226; A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&#39;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#39;t illuminate it. If any of the effect&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary black dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
      &#8226; Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over ld10 days.

The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BLUE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert&#39;s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
      A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
      A blue dragon&#39;s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

      Vain and Deadly.
      A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
      A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm&#39;s reach as it waits to attack again.

      Desert Predators.
      Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon&#39;s eye.
      When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

      Overlords and Minions.
      Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
      A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

      Hoarders of Gems.
      Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
      A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

      A BLUE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
      Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon&#39;s first line of defense.
      A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions&#45; along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC l5 constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      &#8226; Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#39;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary blue dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
      &#8226; Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#39;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (&#45; 5).
      &#8226; Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#39;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.

      If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard.
      A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRASS DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.
      A brass dragon&#39;s head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling&#39;s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon&#39;s scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.

      Boldly Talkative
      A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a·brass dragon&#39;s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon&#39;s thirst for small talk is slaked.
      A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.

      Prized Treasures
      Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.
      Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon&#39;s hoard.

      A BRASS DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      A brass dragon&#39;s desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
      &#8226; A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary brass dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.
      &#8226; Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#39;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
      &#8226; Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#39;s presence and location.

      If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.

      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      BRONZE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.
      A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon&#39;s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling&#39;s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon&#39;s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.

      Dragons of the Coast
      Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship&#39;s captain for the item.

      War Machines
      Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use. When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.

      Well-Organized Wealth
      Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies&#39; means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.

      A BRONZE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.
      &#8226; Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1dl0 days.

He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      COPPER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite , their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.
      A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon&#39;s scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon&#39;s pupils fade with age, and .the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

      Good Hosts
      A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous .story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn&#39;t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.
      Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

      Cautious and Crafty
      When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.
      A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.

      A COPPER DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary copper dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Magic carvings of the dragon&#39;s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#39;t divulge its whereabouts.
      &#8226; Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.

      If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GOLD DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.
      A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon&#39;s sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.

      Devourer of Wealth
      Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn&#39;t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren&#39;t bribes.

      Reserved Shapeshifters
      Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.
      Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.

      Master Hoarders
      A gold dragon keeps its hoard ina well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.

      A GOLD DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon&#39;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary gold dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.
      &#8226; Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair. The mist doesn&#39;t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil cveatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.
      &#8226; Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.

      If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      GREEN DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
      A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
      A wyrmling green dragon&#39;s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
      A green dragon&#39;s legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

      Capricious Hunters
      A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
      Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can he&#39;lp it further its ambitions.
      A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures&#39; activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

      Manipulative Schemers
      A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
      When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

      Conflict and Corruption
      Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades&#45; for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
      Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions&#39; minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions&#39; tortured dreams.

      Living Treasures
      A green dragon&#39;s favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

      A GREEN DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon&#39;s wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature&#39;s poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches, the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
      At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#39;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary green dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement.  A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#39;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.
      Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#39;s path.
      &#8226; Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair serve as the dragon&#39;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

      If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.

      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category	Size		Age Range
      Wyrmling	Medium		5 years or less
      Young		Large		6-100 years
      Adult		Huge		101-800 years
      Ancient		Gargantuan	801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      RED DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
      The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that  metal burned blue by fire.
      The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

      Mountain Masters
      Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

      Arrogant Tyrants
      Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
      No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

      Status and Slaves
      Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
      When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn&#39;t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe&#39;s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

      Obsessive Collectors
      Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
      A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item&#39;s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can&#39;t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

      A RED DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
      With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.
      Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon&#39;s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser&#39;s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      &#8226; A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      &#8226; Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.


      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary red dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
      &#8226; Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon&#39;s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

      If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1dl0 days.

      Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born In the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation. Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.

      Dark Portals.
      Portals to the Shadowfell manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.

      Recast in Shadow.
      The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon&#39;s scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.
      The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane&#39;s malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.

      Back in the World.
      A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to the Material Plane can&#39;t undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the Material Plane.

      SHADOW DRAGON TEMPLATE
      ----------------------------------------
      Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years. A dracolich can&#39;t be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it becomes undead.
      When a dragon becomes a shadow dragon, it retains its statistics except as described below. The shadow dragon might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.

      Damage Resistances.
      The dragon has resistance to necrotic damage.

      Skill Proficiency: Stealth.
      The dragon&#39;s proficiency bonus is doubled for its Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

      Living Shadow.
      While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn&#39;t force, psychic, or radiant.

      Shadow Stealth.
      While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

      Sunlight Sensitivity.
      While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

      New Action: Bite.
      If the dragon deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage with its bite, change that damage type to necrotic.

      New Action: Shadow Breath.
      Any damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon&#39;s control.

    <description>
      True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
      Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
      Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
      True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years
      Adult             Huge          101-800 years
      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      METALLIC DRAGONS
      Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

      Noble Curiosity
      Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren&#39;t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking uncla imed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. A metallic dragon&#39;s treasure hoard is filled with items . that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As s uch, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon&#39;s hoard. A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature&#39;s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon&#39;s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.

      Solitary Shapeshifters
      At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.
      Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.

      The Persistence of Memory
      Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon&#39;s hoard three centuries before.

      King of Good Dragons
      The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries&#45; actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

      Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      SILVER DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.
      A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling&#39;s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.

      Dragons of Virtue
      Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one&#39;s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don&#39;t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

      Friends of the Small Races
      Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong frieqdships.
      Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.

      Respect for Humanity
      Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don&#39;t. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.

      Hoarding History
      Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.

      A SILVER DRAGON&#39;s LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (iosing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
      &#8226; The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
      &#8226; A blistering cold wind. blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1dl0) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      ----------------------------------------
      The region containing a legendary silver dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.
      &#8226; Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#39;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.
      &#8226; Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#39;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.
      &#8226; Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.

      If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.

      DRAGON AGE CATEGORIES
      ----------------------------------------
      Category          Size          Age Range
      Wyrmling          Medium        5 years or less
      Young             Large         6-100 years

      Ancient          Gargantuan     801 years or more

      CHROMATIC DRAGONS
      The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures&#45; including each other.

      Driven by Greed
      Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world&#39;s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon&#39;s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

      Creatures of Ego
      Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon&#39;s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

      Dangerous Lairs
      A dragon&#39;s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
      Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

      Queen of Evil Dragons
      Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
      Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
      Tiamat&#39;s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen&#39;s power.

      VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS
      ----------------------------------------
      Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell&#39;s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon&#39;s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon&#39;s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its Charisma bonus. The dragon&#39;s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

      WHITE DRAGON
      ----------------------------------------
      The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.
      A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.

      Primal and Vengeful
      White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.
      A white dragon a lso keeps the bodies of its greatest enerriies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon&#39;s lair as warnings to intruders.
      Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites.  White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.

      Lone Masters
      White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.

      White dragons can&#39;t abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon&#39;s wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.
      Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon&#39;s obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon&#39;s lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.

      Treasure Under Ice
      White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.
      Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon&#39;s lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon&#39;s breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon&#39;s great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon&#39;s main hoard.
      A white dragon&#39;s flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.

      A WHITE DRAGON&#39;S LAIR
      ----------------------------------------
      White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.
      A legendary white dragon&#39;s innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon&#39;s presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.
      A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.

      LAIR ACTIONS
      On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#39;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
      &#8226; Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
      &#8226; Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
      &#8226; The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#39;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

      REGIONAL EFFECTS
      The region containing a legendary white dragon&#39;s lair is warped by the dragon&#39;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
      &#8226; Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.
      &#8226; Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.
      &#8226; Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#39;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
      If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.

      If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.

      <name>Infestation Spores (3/Day)</name>
      <text>Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in cloud fills a 20-foof-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can&#39;t be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can&#39;t be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature&#39;s body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it&#39;s a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>
