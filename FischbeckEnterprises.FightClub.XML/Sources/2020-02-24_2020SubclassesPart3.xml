      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Artificer Specialist: Armorer (UA)</name>
        <text>An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer&#39;s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</text>

        <name>Power Armor (Armorer (UA))</name>
        <text>Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your artificer magic.  As an action, you can turn a suit of heavy armor you are wearing into power armor, provided you have smith&#39;s tools in hand.</text>
        <text />
        <text>You gain the following benefits while wearing the power armor:</text>
        <text>
          &#183; If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the power armor lacks this requirement for you.
          &#183; You can use the power armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
          &#183; The power armor attaches to you and can&#39;t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, and it replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
</text>
        <text />
        <text>The armor continues to be power armor until you doff it, you don another suit of armor, or you die.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Armor Model</name>
        <text>You can customize your power armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: guardian or infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.</text>
        <text>Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</text>
        <text>You can change your power armor&#39;s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith&#39;s tools in hand.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Guardian. You design your armor to be in the frontline of conflict. It has the following features:</text>
        <text>Thunder Gauntlets. Your armored fists each count as a simple melee weapon, and each deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.</text>
        <text>Defensive Field. You gain a bonus action that you can use on each of your turns to gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Infiltrator. You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:</text>
        <text>Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.</text>
        <text>Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</text>
        <text>Second Skin. The armor&#39;s weight is negligible, and it becomes formfitting and wearable under clothing. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, the power armor doesn&#39;t.</text>

        <name>Armor Modifications (Armorer (UA))</name>
        <text>You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify the armor enhanced by your Power Armor feature. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, bracers, and a weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your power armor.</text>

        <name>Perfected Armor (Armorer (UA))</name>
        <text>Your power armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Guardian. Tinkering with your armor&#39;s energy system leads you to discover a powerful pulling force. When a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled up to 30 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.</text>
        <text />
        <text>     You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Infiltrator. Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5 foot radius, and the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you has advantage. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Stars (UA)</name>
        <text>An ancient lineage, the Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos</text>
        <text>     Many druids of this circle keep detailed records of the stars and their effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground templesâ€”any construction durable enough to protect the circle&#39;s sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.</text>

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Stars (UA): Star Map (Circle of the Stars (UA))</name>
        <text>You&#39;ve created a star map as part of your study of the heavens. The map is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You decide what form the object takes, or you can determine what it is by rolling on the Star Map table.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Star Map</text>
        <text>
          d6 Map Form
          1 A scroll of living wood that aligns with heavenly bodies
          2 A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it
          3 A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks
          4 A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover
          5 A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light
          6 Tempered glass disks that align to depict constellations
</text>
        <text />
        <text>If you lose your map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.</text>
        <text>You can cast the augury and guiding bolt spells without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use the star map as the spellcasting focus. You can cast a spell from the map in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Stars (UA): Stary Form (Circle of the Stars (UA))</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to harness constellations&#39; power to alter your form. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than transforming into a beast.</text>
        <text>     While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body takes on a luminous, starlike quality; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes or until you&#39;re incapacitated.</text>
        <text>     Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:</text>
        <text />
        <text>Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + half your level in this class.</text>
        <text>Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on you. You gain a bonus action that you can use to make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.</text>
        <text> Dragon. A constellation of a wise, ancient dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.</text>

        <text>You learn to use your star map to divine the will of the cosmos. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your star map for omens. When you do so, roll a d6. You gain one of the following possible omens based on whether you rolled an even number or an odd number on the d6:</text>
        <text>Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.</text>
        <text>Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.</text>
        <text />
        <text>You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

    <text>Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.</text>
    <text>    The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.</text>
    <text>    In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.</text>
