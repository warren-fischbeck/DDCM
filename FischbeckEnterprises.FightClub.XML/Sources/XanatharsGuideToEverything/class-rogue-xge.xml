          <name>Roguish Archetype&#58; Inquisitive</name>
        <text>As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your keen deductions make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent&#39;s tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn&#39;t incapacitated, contested by the target&#39;s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don&#39;t have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.</text>
        <text>This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.</text>

        <text>You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunterâ€”these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.</text>

        <text>A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.</text>

        <text>You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don&#39;t need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don&#39;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

        <text>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice&#58;</text>
        <text>&#183; Intelligence score</text>
        <text>&#183; Wisdom score</text>

        <text>At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature&#39;s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</text>
        <text>If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can&#39;t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</text>
        <text>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn&#39;t hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</text>

As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren&#39;t blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.</text>
        <text>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>
