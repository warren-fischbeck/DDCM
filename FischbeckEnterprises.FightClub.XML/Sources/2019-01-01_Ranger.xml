      <feature>
        <name>Favored Enemy</name>
        <text>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds. Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
        <text>	At each odd level, you learn an additional ranger spell of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature>
        <name>Primeval Awareness</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.</text>
        <text>	You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.</text>
        <text>	You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.</text>
        <text>	Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures&#39; general direction and distance (in miles) from you.</text>
        <text>	If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Ranger Conclave</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave: the Beast Conclave, the Hunter Conclave, or the Stalker Conclave, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ranger Conclave: Beast Conclave</name>
        <text>Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beast Conclave develop a close bond with a beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Beast Conclave: Animal Companion</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.</text>
        <text>	With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.</text>
        <text>	At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion&#39;s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</text>
        <text>	If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion&#39;s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</text>
        <text>	If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Beast Conclave: Companion&#39;s Bond</name>
        <text>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</text>
        <text>	The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</text>
        <text>	The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</text>
        <text>	When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
        <text>	Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</text>
        <text>	Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</text>
        <text>	For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</text>
        <text>	Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion&#39;s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can&#39;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</text>
        <text>	Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."</text>
        <text>	Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Trait:</text>
        <text>1. I&#39;m dauntless in the face of adversity.</text>
        <text>2. Threaten my friends, threaten me.</text>
        <text>3. I stay on alert so others can rest.</text>
        <text>4. People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage.</text>
        <text>5. I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time.</text>
        <text>6. I put my friends&#39; needs before my own in all things.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Flaw:</text>
        <text>1. If there&#39;s food left unattended, I&#39;ll eat it.</text>
        <text>2. I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me.</text>
        <text>3. Any time is a good time for a belly rub.</text>
        <text>4. I&#39;m deathly afraid of water.</text>
        <text>5. My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face.</text>
        <text>6. I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them.</text>

        <text>	You also gain access to additional spells at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 15th level. Once you gain a deep stalker spell, it counts as a ranger spell for you but doesn&#39;t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</text>

        <text>	You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. Such creatures gain no benefit when attempting to detect you in dark and dim conditions. Additionally, when the DM determines if you can hide from a creature, that creature gains no benefit from its darkvision.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you form a bond with a nature spirit&#8212;a companion forged by your link to the wild. This spirit companion protects you as you travel and watches your back in battle. You choose a ranger path that shapes your spirit companion and its magic: the Guardian, the Seeker, or the Stalker. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</text>
        <text>	</text>
        <text>Spirit Companion:</text>
        <text>	All rangers gain a spirit companion and the ability to invoke its magical power. (Your spirit companion grants you one benefit you can call on in this playtest version of the revised ranger, with more benefits gained at higher levels.) You regain your ability to call on your spirit companion in this way when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>	Once per day as a bonus action, you can command your spirit companion to materialize as a living creature, determined by the ranger path you choose. Your spirit companion manifests as an animal for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). You can also dismiss it as a bonus action.</text>
        <text>	The manifested creature gains a bonus to attack rolls and saving throws equal to your Wisdom modifier. It uses the hit points in the animal&#39;s stat block or half your hit point maximum, whichever is higher.</text>
        <text>	The manifested creature takes its turn on your initiative and acts immediately after you. You control its actions, even if you are unconscious or otherwise unable to act.</text>

You patrol the pathways through the wilds, keeping them clear of bandits and rampaging monsters, even as you keep careful watch on how civilized realms interact with the wilderness.

        <text>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast&#39;s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</text>
        <text>	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn&#39;t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
        <text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
        <text>	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
        <text>	If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn&#39;t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</text>

You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</text>
