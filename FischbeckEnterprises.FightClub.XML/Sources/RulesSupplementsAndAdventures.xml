		<text>The Tome of Strahd is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact.</text>

		<detail>rare, cursed (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight>65</weight>
		<text>This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren&#8217;t incapacitated. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; The armor doesn&#8217;t impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; The armor doesn&#8217;t impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide). </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Curse: </text>
		<text>	This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10+45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a wish spell can remove the armor&#8217;s curse.</text>

		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>legendary (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight>4</weight>
		<text>Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep. Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon, but the weapon is searching for a new owner.</text>
		<text>	Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with deep blue luminescence.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Magic Weapon: You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier or magic force.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>	When you hit a fiend or an undead with this axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal and extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Hurling: The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Illumination: While holding the axe you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Sentience: Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
		<text>	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful characters within 120 feet of it.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Personality: Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.</text>
		<text>	If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a Wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered to without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.</text>

		<name>Blackstaff</name>
		<type>ST</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>legendary (requires attunement by the Blackstaff heir, who must be a wizard)</detail>
		<weight>4</weight>
		<text>The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can. however, choose a new owner (see " Personality" below).</text>
		<text>	The Blackstaff has the magical properties of a Staff of Power (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) in addition to the following properties.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Animate Walking Statues: You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see "Personality" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Dispel Magic: You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Drain Magic: This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Master of Enchantment: When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 +the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Sentience: The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Personality: The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.</text>
		<text>	In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor- someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.</text>
		<text>  </text>
		<text>Spirit Trap: When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)</text>
		<text>	Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.</text>

		<detail>uncommon (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight>3</weight>
		<text>Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.</text>
		<text>	When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property &#8212; the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

		<weight>1</weight>
		<text>This +3 dagger belongs to Artus Cimber (see appendix D). While you have the dagger drawn, you can use a bonus action to activate one of the following properties: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Cause a blue gem set into the dagger&#8217;s pommel to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or make the gem go dark. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Turn the dagger into a compass that, while resting on your palm, points north. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Cast dimension door from the dagger. Once this property is used, it can&#8217;t be used again until the next dawn. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Cast compulsion (save DC 15) from the dagger. The range of the spell increases to 90 feet, but it targets only spiders that are beasts. Once this property is used, it can&#8217;t be used again until the next dawn.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

		<weight>3</weight>
		<text>Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appears to be a gilded longsword hilt.  While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. Dawnbringer has all the properties of a sun blade: you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</text>
		<text>	The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. </text>
		<text>	While holding the weapon, you an use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used. this ability can't be used again until the next dawn. </text>
		<text>	Sentience: Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>
		<text>	The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you're attuned to it. </text>
		<text>	Personality: Forged by ancient sun worshipers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies. </text>
		<text>	Long years last in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
		<text>	</text>

		<text>In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), the frost giant lord Gurt fell to Uthgar Gardolfsson &#8212; leader of the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbarians-in a battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin Valley. Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it. </text>
		<text>	You gain a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human. The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below O degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions. As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>

		<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you throw it, its normal and long ranges both increase by 30 feet (included in range). and it deals one extra die of damage on a hit. After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately. </text>
		<text>Curse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one. </text>
		<text>	Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>

		<text>The Korolnor Scepter is one of ten Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, forged by the dwarven gods and given to the ruling houses of the ancient dwarven empire. The Korolnor Scepter's location was unknown for the longest time until a storm giant queen, Neri, found it in a barnacle- covered shipwreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. The Ruling Scepters are all roughly the same size and shape, but their materials and properties vary. The Korolnor Scepter is a tapered mithral rod as thick and long as a dwarf's forearm, with a small platinum knob at the bottom and a rounded disk adorned with a ring of seven tiny blue gems at the top. </text>
		<text>	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this scepter, which can be wielded as a magic club. </text>

		<text>	 </text>

		<detail>legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned dwarf, fighter, or paladin)</detail>
		<weight>7</weight>
		<text>A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.</text>
		<text>	You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You can't be surprised by orcs while you're not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be frightened while you're not incapacitated. </text>
		<text>	Sentience: Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse. </text>
		<text>	Personality: Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves &#8212; giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs &#8212; and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

		<text>Saint Markovia's thighbone has the properties of a mace of disruption. If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.</text>
		<text>	As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.</text>
		<text>	Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.</text>
		<text>	Suffused with confidence born of a righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.</text>
		<text>	The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.</text>

		<text>Mace of Disruption: When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text>	While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</text>

After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately. </text>
		<text>Curse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one. </text>
		<text>	Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear.</text>

		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>legendary (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight>3</weight>
		<text>The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.</text>
		<text>	Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.</text>
		<text>	The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Sentience: The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying it or wielding it.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Personality: The Sunsword's special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Sun blade: This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the sun blade.</text>
		<text>	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</text>
		<text>	The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property &#8212; the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

		<text>	The sword also functions as a wand of enemy detection. It regains all of its expended charges at dawn and isn't at risk of crumbling if its last charge is used. </text>
		<text>	Sentience: Waythe is a sentient weapon of neutral good alignment, with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 2, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>
		<text>	The weapon can speak and understand Giant and Common, and it can communicate telepathically with its wielder. </text>
		<text>	Personality: This sword believes in freedom and allowing others to live as they see fit. It is protective of its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned character to gain attunement with the sword.) Waythe is courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and vocally urges bold action. It is likely to come into conflict with an evil or a timid wielder.</text>

A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can&#8217;t melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring. </text>
		<text>	The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see &#8220;Sentient Magic Items&#8221; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer&#8217;s doom. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Sentience: </text>
		<text>	The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Nondetection: </text>
		<text>	The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Frozen Time: </text>
		<text>	As long as you wear the ring, you don&#8217;t age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn&#8217;t catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn&#8217;t protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Cold Immunity: </text>
		<text>	While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don&#8217;t suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide). </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Magic: </text>
		<text>	The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of &#8211;30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby&#8217;s hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke&#8217;s freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2charges). </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can&#8217;t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator&#8217;s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Other Properties: </text>
		<text>	The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can&#8217;t break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Destroying the Ring: </text>
		<text>	The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.</text>

		<text>A mind flayer skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the mind flayer can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the mind flayer can see through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the mind flayer can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.</text>
		<text>	If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the mind flayer that created it is blinded for 2d12 hours.</text>

		<text>Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry of the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.</text>
		<text>	If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Vampiric Strike: The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Blight Bane: While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property &#8212; the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

		<type>ST</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</detail>
		<weight>4</weight>
		<text>This crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten archmage whom Acererak destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull&#8217;s forehead is Acererak&#8217;s rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Beneficial Properties: </text>
		<text>	While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; You can&#8217;t be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Invoke Curse: </text>
		<text>	The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can&#8217;t regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A greater restoration, remove curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>The Forgotten One: </text>
		<text>	The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff&#8217;s skull protects Acererak from this spirit&#8217;s vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff&#8217;s charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM&#8217;s control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a dispel evil and good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Destroying the Staff:. A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone&#8217;s guess. </text>
		<text>	Casting the staff into a sphere of annihilation destroys both the staff and the life force trapped within it. The staff doesn&#8217;t explode if destroyed in this manner, but its destruction causes the sphere to be destroyed as well.</text>

		<text>This amulet is carved from obsidian and shaped like a screaming humanoid skull, with ruby eyes and emeralds for teeth. It hangs from an iron chain necklace. </text>
		<text>	The amulet has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet of you. The destination you choose doesn&#8217;t need to be in your line of sight, but it must be familiar to you (in other words, a place you have seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. This effect isn&#8217;t subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods; thus, the amulet can be used to enter and exit the tomb. </text>
		<text>	If you aren&#8217;t undead, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw each time you use the amulet to teleport.

Creatures of flesh that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against flesh to stone cast from the bracelet. If such a creature's save is successful, the bracelet breaks your attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are petrified instantly.</text>

		<name>Devastation Orb of Air</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>very rare</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</text>
		<text>	A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</text>
		<text>	A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</text>
		<text>	Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</text>
		<text>	Air Orb: When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.</text>

The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.</text>

Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood's path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.</text>

		<detail>unique</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>The Draakhorn was a gift from Tiamat in the war between dragons and giants. It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.</text>
		<text>	The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.</text>
		<text>	Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons &#8212; a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.</text>
		<text>	Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.</text>
		<text>	For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence &#8212; because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.</text>
		<text>	While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. </text>

If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the feather into a Large unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you, the feather becomes a living diatryma for up to 6 hours, after which it reverts to its feather form. It reverts to feather form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching the bird.</text>
		<text>	When the diatryma reverts to feather form, the magic of the feather can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</text>
		<text>	The diatryma uses the statistics of an Axe Beak, except that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions.</text>

		<text>This wooden gavel is small by giant reckoning but nearly the size of a warhammer in human hands. The venn (friend) rune is inscribed in mithral in the base of the haft. Among giants, this item is used as part of rituals to resolve disputes. The gavel has the following properties. </text>

		<text>Arbiter's Shield: At the start of every combat, attack rolls against you have disadvantage before the start of your first turn, provided that the gavel is on your person. </text>

		<text>Bond of Amity: As an action, you can use the gavel to strike a point on a hard surface. The first time in the next minute that a creature within 60 feet of that point deals damage to another creature with an attack that hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt to the target. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Gift of Truth: You can transfer the gavel's magic to a place by tracing the venn rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 30-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the gavel to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the gavel is destroyed, and the area gains the following property: </text>

		<text>This dark cloak is made of cured hell hound hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a hell hound for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the polymorph spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. </text>
		<text>Curse: This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hell hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times. </text>
		<text>	The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to O hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in hell hound form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a hell hound. Thereafter, only remove curse or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.</text>

		<text>The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven &#8212; or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.</text>
		<text>	The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.</text>

		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Hold Vampires: As an Action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Turn Undead: If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</text>

		<text>A narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed. You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again. The tack doesn&#8217;t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.</text>

		<text>	The rod has 10 charges and regains1d6+4 of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the locate object spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.</text>

		<weight></weight>
		<text>This shard of ice is long and slender, roughly the size of a dagger. The ise (ice) rune glows within it. The shard has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Frigid Touch: As an action, you can touch a body of water and freeze the water in a 10-foot-radius sphere around the spot you touched. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Frost Friend: You have resistance to fire damage. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Icy Mantle: As an action, you can touch yourself or another creature with water on your finger. The water creates an icy mantle of protection. The next time within the next minute that the target takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, that damage is reduced to 0, and the mantle is destroyed. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Winter's Howl: As an action, you can cast sleet storm (spell save DC 17). You regain this ability after you finish a short or long rest. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Gift of Frost. You can transfer the shard's magic to a nonmagical item &#8212; a cloak or a pair of boots &#8212; by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Cloak: The cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you have resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in snowy terrain. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Boots: The pair of boots is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you ignore difficult terrain while walking, and you can walk on water.</text>

		<text>Smokepowder is a magical explosive chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a firearm. It is stored in airtight wooden kegs or tiny, waterproof leather packets. A packet contains enough smokepowder for five shots, and a keg holds enough smokepowder for five hundred shots.</text>
		<text>	If smokepowder is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.</text>
		<text>	Casting dispel magic on smokepowder renders it permanently inert.</text>

		<name>Stone of Golorr</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an aboleth named Golorr, transformed by magic into an object.</text>
		<text>	Random Properties: The Stone of Golorr has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide:

	&#8226; 1 minor beneficial property
	&#8226; 1 minor detrimental property
		</text>
		<text>	Legend Lore: The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.</text>
		<text>	By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.</text>
		<text>	The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.</text>
		<text>	Failed Memory: When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically.</text>
		<text>	Sentience: The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence or 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. Io addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.</text>
		<text>	The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see " Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</text>
		<text>	Personality: The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.</text>
		<text>	Destroying the Stone: While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.</text>

Until the curse is discovered, the DM secretly applies this penalty, assuming you are adding the item's bonus. You are unwilling to part with the stone until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic.</text>

		<text>Created by the stone giant librarians of Gravenhollow, this nineteen-inch-long shard of quartz grants you advantage on Intelligence (investigation) checks while it is on your person.</text>
		<text>	The crystal has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: speak with animals (2 charges), speak with dead (4 charges), or speak with plants (3 charges).</text>
		<text>	When you cast a divination spell, you can use the crystal in place of one material component that would normally be consumed by the spell, at a cost of 1 charge per level of the spell. The crystal is not consumed when used in this way.</text>
		<text>	The crystal regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the crystal's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal vanishes, lost forever.</text>

		<weight></weight>
		<text>A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A water weird (see the Monster Manual for statistics) is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the water weird to emerge. The water weird acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.</text>
		<text>	You can command the water weird telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the water weird to retract into it or if the water weird is dead.</text>
		<text>	If the water weird is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new water weird forms inside it.</text>
		<text>	The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the water weird contained within it.</text>

		<text>	Damage Absorption: You have resistance against cold damage. If you already have resistance to cold damage from another source, you instead have immunity to cold damage. If you already have immunity to cold damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to cold damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt of that type.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>	Draconic Majesty: While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>	Dragon Breath: If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>	Dragon Sight: You gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain blindsight out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>	Dragon Tongue: You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against White Dragons.</text>
		<text>	</text>

		<text>This snug uniform has symbols of air stitched into it and leathery flaps that stretch along the arms, waist, and legs to create wings for gliding. A suit of wingwear has 3 charges. While you wear the suit, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until you land. At the end of each of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn't fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet, you land (or fall), and you must expend another charge to use the suit again.</text>

		<name>Wyrmskull Throne</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>artifact</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire, the Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet &#8212; the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated. </text>
		<text>	After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership. </text>
		<text>	Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne. </text>
		<text>	Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic &#8212; the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master. </text>
		<text>	Properties of the Throne: The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows: </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>&#8226; As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks. </text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Destroying the Throne: The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

		<text>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the entangle spell (save DC 13) from it. </text>
		<text>	The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</text>

		<type>WD</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight>1</weight>
		<text>Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting modifier) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.</text>
		<text>	Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of oil of etherealness or universal solvent. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.</text>
		<text>	The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wands last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.</text>

		<weight>1</weight>
		<text>This wand looks and feels like an icicle. You must be attuned to the want to use it.</text>
		<text>	The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: ray of frost (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), sleet storm (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or ice storm (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No components are required. The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed.</text>

		<text>As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can&#8217;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
		<text>	When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier:</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Autumn: Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Winter: When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Spring: When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Summer: Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</text>

		<name>Shifting Seasons</name>
		<text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin&#8217;s mood:</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer&#8217;s harvest is shared with all.</text>
		<text>Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</text>
		<text>Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter&#8217;s sorrow passes.</text>
		<text>Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>	Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&#8217;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</text>

            <name>Martial Archetype: Purple Dragon Knight</name>
            <text>Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom&#8217;s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</text>
            <text>	A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>
            <text>	A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&#8217;s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</text>

		<text>You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. </text>
		<text>	You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. </text>
		<text>	Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands. </text>
		<text>	Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.</text>

You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford. Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.</text>

		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faer&#251;n aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. </text>
		<text>	As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faer&#251;n. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own.

		<name>Factions of the Sword Coast</name>
		<text>The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Harpers: Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Order of the Gauntlet: One of the newest power groups in Faer&#251;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Emerald Enclave: Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Lords' Alliance: On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Zhentarim: In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born. </text>
		<text>	You aren't one of those folk. </text>
		<text>	You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faer&#251;n for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. </text>
		<text>	Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</text>
	</trait>
	<trait>
		<name>Why Are You Here?</name>
		<text>A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll 1d6 or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>1. Emissary </text>
		<text>2. Exile </text>
		<text>3. Fugitive </text>
		<text>4. Pilgrim </text>
		<text>5. Sightseer </text>
		<text>6. Wanderer</text>
	</trait>
	<trait>
		<name>Where Are You From?</name>
		<text>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Evermeet: The fabled elven is lands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faer&#251;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&#251;n for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Halruaa: Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&#251;n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faer&#251;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Kara-Tur: The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faen1n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&#251;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&#251;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Mulhorand: From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&#251;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faer&#251;n. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Sossal: Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Zakhara: As the saying goes among those in Faer&#251;n who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&#251;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Underdark: Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</text>

		<text>	You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.</text>

		<text>You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean.

	<trait>
		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Before becoming an adventurer, you were a successful merchant operating out Hillsfar, the City of Trade. Your family operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, or owned a ship and has trade contacts throughout the Moonsea region, as well as up and down the length of the Sword Coast. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into the City of Trade, or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or Dragon's Breath, a brandy-like liquor. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Alternate Feature: Trade Contract</name>
		<text>You and your family have trade contacts such as caravan masters, shopkeepers, sailors, artisans, and farmers throughout the Moonsea region and all along the Sword Coast.

He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the family assigns you another within a few days.</text>

		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Hillsfar is the City of Trade. However, the Great Law of Trade only protects "legitimate" trade, trade that passes through the city's sole gate, which the Red Plumes monitor and tax. And the Great Law of Humanity banishes non- humans from the city altogether. The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.</text>
		<text>	Perhaps you trafficked Dragon's Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non- humans and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price.</text>

Your Dungeon Master will determine whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city. In return for your passage, you and your companions may owe the Rouges Guild a favor and/or may have to pay bribes.</text>

		<text>Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from the possibilities below.

You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.</text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item&apos;s history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.</text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.</text>

		<text>Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.</text>
		<text>	The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.</text>
		<text>	When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.</text>

		<name>Description</name>
		<text>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faer&#251;n has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faer&#251;n don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause. </text>
	</trait>
	<trait>
		<name>Knightly Orders of Faer&#251;n</name>
		<text>Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&#251;n who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Knights of the Unicorn: The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriarch families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Knights of Myth Drannor: Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Knights of the Silver Chalice: The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</text>

Knights of civic orders can get help from the community &#8212; whether a lone settlement or a great nation &#8212; that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.</text>
		<text>	This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</text>

		<text>As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one.  </text>
		<text>	Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Mercenaries of the North</name>
		<text>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Chill: The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few citystates in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Silent Rain: Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>The Bloodaxes: Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.</text>

		<text>In general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted.</text>

		<text>	In your migrations, your people have come to know the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant&#8217;s Cairn. The dragon cultists came to the hills one day&#8212;magic-users wearing purple and riding horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. </text>
		<text>	You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faer&#251;n's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar &#8212; any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. </text>
		<text>	As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives &#8212; but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Description</name>
		<text>Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. </text>
		<text>	Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.</text>
		<text>	You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer.</text>
	</trait>
	<trait>
		<name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
		<text>Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds &#8212; great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred- are sacred to you. </text>
		<text> </text>
		<text>Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Description</name>
		<text>You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faer&#251;n for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. </text>
		<text>	Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy? </text>
		<text>	Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of &#8212; there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility.</text>

		<text>Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know- one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family a lone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.</text>

You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income &#8212; the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.</text>

			<name>Sulfurous Impersonation</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum.

			<name>Eat Memories</name>
			<text>The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>	While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>

			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to and wearing the ring, Artus can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can expend 1 charge and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 300 feet of him. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of _30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless Artus uses the ring to end the effect as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can expend the necessary number of charges and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus's choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</text>

			<name>Demiplanar Donjon</name>
			<text>Any creature or object that the astral dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a wish spell or this creature's Donjon Visit ability. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of the dreadnought's past meals. The dreadnought can't be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the corpse. The demiplane is otherwise indestructible.</text>

			<name>Shapechanger</name>
			<text>The barghest can use its action to polymorph into a Small goblin or back into its true form. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
		</trait>

			<name>Fire Banishment</name>
			<text>When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in flames that are at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be instantly banished to Gehenna.

		<trait>
			<name>Soul Feeding</name>
			<text>A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.</text>
			<text>	While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.</text>

			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<name>Death Gaze</name>
			<text>When a creature that can see the bodak&#8217;s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the bodak, the bodak can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the bodak isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, unless it is immune to the frightened condition. Otherwise, a creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so. it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the bodak until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the bodak in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.</text>

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<name>Adhesive Filament</name>
			<text>The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Grappled:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	</text>

On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can&#8217;t extrude another filament.</text>

			<text>The chamberlain releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

			<text>When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of 1d6 + 3 humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.</text>
			<text>	While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the following:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn't under its control, and the flower's stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait).</text>

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>

			<name>Gaze</name>
			<text>Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
			<text>	If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:</text>
			<text>	1. Beguiling Gaze: The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.</text>
			<text>	2. Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.</text>
			<text>	3. Insanity Gaze: The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.</text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears. </text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn&#8217;t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.</text>

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns.

		<legendary>
			<name>Heat Wave</name>
			<text>Imix creates a blast of heat within 300 feet of himself. Each creature in the area in physical contact with metal objects (for example, carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor) takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each creature in the area that isn't resistant or immune to fire damage must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

			<name>Combustion (Costs 3 Actions)</name>
			<text>Imix causes one creature he can see within 30 feet of him to burst into flames. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 70 (20d6) fire damage and catches fire. A target on fire takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it starts its turn, and remains on fire until it or another creature takes an action to douse the flames. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The iron cobra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>
		</trait>
		<action>
			<name>Bite</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2. Alchemist&#8217;s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target&#8217;s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm&#8217;s turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can&#8217;t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn&#8217;t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can&#8217;t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative.

			<text>While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick.</text>
			<text>	When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall moves, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends.</text>

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>Any ship a merrenoloth is contracted to captain becomes the creature's lair. When fighting on the ship, the merrenoloth can invoke its ability to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the merrenoloth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; The ship regains 22 (4d10) hit points.</text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; The air within 60 feet of the ship is filled with howling wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Prone:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</text>

			<text>&#8226; The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</text>

			<text>Eye Rays. The mindwitness shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1. Aversion Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Psychic Ray: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 27 (6d8) psychic damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4. Slowing Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target&#8217;s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can&#8217;t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5. Stunning Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6. Telekinetic Ray: If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the mindwitness moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained by the ray&#8217;s telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness&#8217;s next turn or until the mindwitness is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Devour Soul</name>
			<text>A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a wish spell.</text>

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul under the nabassu's control.</text>

			<name>Constructed Nature</name>
			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<text>The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>

			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>

			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

			<text>When the phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within 60-feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't worn or carried.</text>
			<text>	The explosion destroys the phoenix's body and leaves behind an egg-shaped cinder that weighs 5 pounds. The cinder is blazing hot, dealing 21 (6d6) fire damage to any creature that touches it, though no more than once per round. The cinder is immune to all damage, and after 1d6 days, it hatches a new phoenix.</text>

			<text>When a creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of three or more rutterkins, it must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened of the rutterkins for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature is restrained.

			<text>The wave shaper targets a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, causing a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, 25 feet tall, and lasts for 1 minute or until the wave shaper is incapacitated. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. 
			When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until it ends. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has disadvan· tage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. 
			The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</text>

		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Warp Creature</name>
			<text>The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Poisoned:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Variant: Flesh Warping</name>
			<text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.</text>
			<text>	A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d100 &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>01&#8211;05 &#8212; The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.</text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>16&#8211;20 &#8212; One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>21&#8211;25 &#8212; The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>26&#8211;30 &#8212; A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>31&#8211;35 &#8212; The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.</text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>41&#8211;45 &#8212; The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>46&#8211;50 &#8212; The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>51&#8211;55 &#8212; The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>56&#8211;60 &#8212; The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>61&#8211;65 &#8212; The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>66&#8211;70 &#8212; The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>71&#8211;75 &#8212; The target swells, tripling its weight.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>76&#8211;80 &#8212; The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>81&#8211;85 &#8212; The target's head doubles in size.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>86&#8211;90 &#8212; The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>91&#8211;95 &#8212; The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>96&#8211;00 &#8212; The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.</text>

			<text>Deafened:</text>

			<text>The spawn of Kyuss regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&#8217;t in sunlight or a body of running water.

			<name>Burrowing Worm</name>
			<text>A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target&#8217;s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target&#8217;s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target&#8217;s skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<name>False Appearance</name>
			<text>While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.</text>

			<text>The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<name>Shapechanger</name>
			<text>If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat, a Medium wolf, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.</text>
			<text>	While in bat or wolf form, Strahd can't speak. In bat form, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying speed of 30 feet. In wolf form, his walking speed is 40 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.</text>

			<text>	While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.</text>

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if  its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control.</text>

The charmed target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.</text>
			<text>	Each time Strahd or his companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall into a magical sleep and be unconscious for 10 minutes.

			<text>As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.</text>
			<text>	The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped.</text>

			<text>Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in cloud fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>
