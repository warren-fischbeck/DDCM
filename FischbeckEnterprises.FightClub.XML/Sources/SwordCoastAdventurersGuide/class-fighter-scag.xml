          <name>Martial Archetype&#58; Purple Dragon Knight (Banneret)</name>
        <text>Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom&#39;s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</text>
        <text>A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>
        <text>A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&#39;s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</text>
