    <text>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon or thrown melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to pin an appendage to itself or to an object it is in contact with.  You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll.  While the creature is pinned in this manner it looses the use of the appendage and must spend an Action freeing itself.</text>

    <text>When you expend one superiority die, you can target a 5 foot area that you do not have line of sight to.  You must make this attack with a ranged weapon or thrown melee weapon that you are proficient with.  The target area must be within the weapons normal range, and you must be able to arc the ranged weapon over, under or around any object that is interfearing with the normal rules of line of sight.  On a successful attack, you can add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll.</text>

    <text>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon or thrown melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to target one of the creatures legs.  You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll and until the start of your next turn, the target treats all terrain as difficult, existing difficult terrain costs an additional 1 foot of movement per 1 foot traversed.</text>

    <text>When you hit a creature with a thrown melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to stun the target.  You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll, and if the target is one size larger than you or smaller, it must make a strength saving throw.  On a failed save it is stunned until the end of your next turn.</text>
    <text>Stunned&#58;</text>
    <text>&#183; A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, can&#39;t move, and can speak only falteringly.</text>
    <text>&#183; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
    <text>&#183; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>

    <text>You touch a willing creature who isn&#39;t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target&#39;s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier.  The magical force also conveys 5 temporary hit points.  The spell ends it if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.</text>
    <text>At Higher Levels&#58; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the target gains 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 2nd.</text>

    <text>You interupt a creature in the process of making a weapon attack against you.  If the attack is with a ranged weapon, the creature needs to select a new target within 30 feet from you or forfeit its attack.  If the creature is attacking you with a melee weapon, it needs to select a new target within 5ft of you that it can reach or forfeit its attack.  If the creature has multiple attacks, any further attacks targeting you has disadvantage.</text>

    <text>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of making an attack. If the creature is taking an attack action with a nonmagical weapon, its attack action fails and has no effect. If it is taking an attack action with a magical weapon, it needs to make a Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target of the attack action has resistance to one of the damage types caused by the attack.  On a successful saving throw, the spell has no effect on the attack.</text>
