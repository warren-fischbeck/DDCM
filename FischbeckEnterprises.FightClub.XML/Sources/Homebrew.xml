    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  The blade was forged in the icy breath of a long forgotten white dragon and as such the blade has a white, frosted look to it.  A giant milk quartz makes up the cross guard, the quartz is cut to resemble the outstretched limbs of a dragon, each claw clutching a blood red ruby.  The pommel is a circular disk with each side having the nine blades carved in it.  The hilt is wrapped in supple yeti hide.</text>
    <text />
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  On a successful melee hit with the blade, the target takes an extra 3d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have vulnerability to fire damage.</text>
    <text />
    <text>In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used once per short rest.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property — the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This rapier has a darkened blade, hardened in an ancient black dragon's pool of acid. When drawn, the blade glistens with acid. The basket hilt is crafted of a copper mesh made to resemble the drowning vines that inhabit many bogs.  The grip is made of 7 glass beads that shows how much acid is left in the blade before it runs dry for the day.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When the command word "vellious" is spoken as a bonus action, one of the doses of acid stored in the grip is transferred to the blade. On the next successful attack made with the blade, the weapon adds 1d6 acid damage.  The grip houses seven such doses, all used doses are replenished at dawn.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When traveling through swamps, the bearer of this blade knows which way is north and cannot become lost.</text>
    <text />
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to acid damage.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This dagger crackles with lightning when drawn.  The blade is silvered and etched in ancient runes that names this blade as The Tooth of the Dragon.  The hilt and cross guard are shapped to resemble a blue dragon with outstretched wings.</text>
    <text />
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  On a successful melee hit the blade, the target takes an extra 1d4 lightning damage, as lightning arcs from the wings of the dragon into the target. In addition, while you hold the dagger, you have resistance to lightning damage.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When traveling through desert terrain the bearer of this blade cannot be surprised by any non-magical means.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>

    <text>This legendary weapon is one of 10 blades that make up the Mouth of the Dragon.  This greatsword was forged in the firey breath of Veilendrex, an ancient red dragon.  It was he who started building the Mouth of the Dragon by enslaving wizards, sorcerers and clerics.  When drawn, the runes that race down the blade glow with red fury, spelling out Veilendrex - the mouth of the dragon.  His gold tipped tail wraps around the blade close to the cross guard. His body makes up the hilt, each scale is encrusted with crushed red rubies.  His masive head is the pommel, sculpted in anger. Smoke wafts out of the mouth as the blade is swung in combat.</text>
    <text />
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  You can use a bonus action to speak this sword's command word - Veilendrex, causing flames to erupt from the blade.  These flames shead bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet.  While the sword is ablase, it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage to any target it hits.  The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have vulnerability to cold damage.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Once per day the wielder of the blade can cast fireball as a 5th level spell, however the normal flame function will not work until the dawn of the following day.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

    <text>Flan, a hero of a bygone god, had this bow crafted out of the heart of a yew tree for his quest to save the harbor master's daughter from the villainous goblin horde.  It was his lightning reflexes and essence that embed the yew shaft and provides the extra punch that this bow offers.</text>
    <text />
    <text>As part of an attack action, on the first successfully hit target, every creature in a 15 foot diameter radius from the target needs to make a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 electrical damage, and no damage on a successful save.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
    <text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
    <text />

      legendary (requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

      This spear can be wielded as a magic spear that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.
      The spear has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6+2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12+1 charges.

      Spell Absorption: While holding the spear, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell&#39;s level. However, if doing so brings the spear&#39;s total number of charges above 50, the spear explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

      Spells: While holding the spear, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges)
      You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the spear without using any charges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.

      Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the spear over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The spear is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.
      You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

      Distance from Origin — Damage:
      10 ft. away or closer — 8 x the number of charges in the spear
      11 to 20 ft. away — 6 x the number of charges in the spear
      21 to 30 ft. away — 4 x the number of charges in the spear

      Proficiency: simple, spear

    <text>This legendary shortsword is also known as a the Giant's hamstring, after the favored tactic of the renown fighter Qwalth.  In the age of Giants, Qwalth left the dwarven holds, along side his brethren, and joined battle to drive them back. This finely crafted mithril blade, golden crossguard and sapphire pommeled sword was almost as feared among the giants as Qwalth himself.  The legend of the pair during the wars was well warranted and often a turning point when they took the field.</text>
    <text />
    <text>This shortsword grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.</text>

    <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.</text>
    <text />
    <text>This legendary weapon was created by the wizard Hecton the Bald.  In times long ago, his accuracy with his spells were legendary and only became more so after he crafted the spear.</text>
    <text />
    <text>The ash wood for the shaft has been petrified by the gaze of a Madusa.  The spear head is forged of damascus steel.  An ancient blue dragon's roar merged the two components of the spear into one unified object.</text>
    <text />
    <text>This spear grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.</text>
    <text />
    <text>When thrown as part of an attack action, the spear will do an extra 3D6 of thunder damage on a successful hit.  This property can be used once per short rest.</text>

    <text />
    <text>Lendarth was a legendary hero of a bygone era.  His death dance was a thing of beauty, often causing even his opponents to stare in wonder as death descended.  He made a heroic sacrifice in the Lich Wars opening battle.  He fell holding a bridge as the defeated army retreated.  This was his greatest dance, laying waste to the Lich lords skeleton troops.  Something in that fight was absorbed by the bracers he wore, for when they were given to his next of kin, his dance could be seen in her fighting style.</text>
    <text />
    <text>The bracers holds 5 charges.  It regains 1d4-1 expended charges daily at dawn.</text>
    <text>While wearing the bracers, as part of an attack action that uses a Battle Master Maneuver you can use one or more charges to increase the superiority die type by one category per charge expended. A d6 becomes a d8, d8 becomes a d10, d10 becomes a d12 and a d12 becomes a d20.</text>
    <text />
    <text>If the bracers remain at 0 charges for two consecutive days, it's enchantment is broken and it is now considered a mundane set of brackers.</text>

    <text>Backbreaker was originally forged during THE SECOND AGE and used by the forces of the mind flayers. It eventually fell into the hands of the Slaad hero Crroock.  Crroock used the weapon to great effect during it's lifetime, but eventually Crroock and the blade went missing.   Backbreaker resurfaced again during THE FOURTH AGE as the primary weapon of the Orc War Chief Plunyyak and became the tribal weapon of the Backbreaker Clan.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Backbreaker remained with the Backbreaker clan until it's might was smashed by the encroaching elves of Helms.  There Backbreaker was both a trophy and family heirloom weapon of the Umbra-Vastator family.  During The War of Elven Submission the blade was captured by the Order of the White Rose and placed in Boarderland's The Manor of Infinite Mirrors.</text>
    <text />
    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  On a successful melee hit against aberrations the target will also take an extra 1d6 radiant damage.</text>
    <text />
    <text>The sword holds three charges.  While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast banishment using DC 14 for the charisma saving throw and using your concentration to maintain the effect.  It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Mutant, Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, or Order of the Lycan. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
        <text>There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and blasphemous rituals. One must adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter's Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once they've proven their ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. Some even wait a few years before they are sure they want to continue down this cursed path. Either or, it's within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood hunter is learned.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Order of the Ghostslayer</name>
        <text>The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest and most driven of the orders, having rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of the death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition. Some will sit with the terminally diseased to closely witness their passing, while others go so far as to deliberately have a near-death experience, allowing them to tune to their body and senses to the ethereal realms beyond.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Rite of the Dawn</name>
        <text>When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the esoteric Rite of the Dawn.</text>
        <text>  • Rite of the Dawn. Your rite damage is radiant type.</text>
        <text>If you hit an Undead creature with your Rite of the Dawn, it suffers additional radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</text>
        <text>Upon reaching 11th level, any creature you hit with your Rite of the Dawn suffers this additional radiant damage.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Order of the Profane Soul</name>
        <text>The magics adopted by the wayward blood hunter prove formidable against many an evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance. These fiends are far trickier to hunt, and many lost their lives in pursuit of such wickedness.</text>
        <text>A small sect of blood hunters had finally had enough and delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outweighed the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Profane Soul: Otherworldly Patron</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed on page 109 of the PHB or the Undying on page 139 of the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. Your choice augments some of your order features.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Profane Soul: Pact Magic</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the PHB for the Warlock spell list.</text>
        <text>Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Warlock spell list. You learn an additional Warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</text>
        <text>Spell Slots. The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your Warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</text>
        <text>Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher. At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Warlock spell list.</text>
        <text>The total spell known are equal to the Warlock level divided by 2, rounded up. A spell you choose to learn must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's (listed at the beginning of this class description) Slot Level column for our level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
        <text>Additionally when you get a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
        <text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Profane Soul: Rite Focus</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While you have an active rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the PHB) for your spells. Your chosen pact also enhances your rite (outlined below).</text>
        <text>  • The Archfey. If you deal rite damage to a creature, that creature loses any half or three-quarters cover bonuses, as well as invisibility, until the beginning of your next turn.</text>
        <text>  • The Fiend. While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 on your rite damage die, you may reroll the die. You may reroll only once per attack.</text>
        <text>  • The Great Old One. Whenever you deal a critical hit to a creature, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</text>
        <text>  • The Undying. Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, and kill it, you regain hit points equal to your crimson rite damage die.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Mutant</name>
        <text>The process of consuming the Hunter's Bane is a painful, scarring, and often fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one's own physiology through corrupted alchemy.</text>
        <text>Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time become something beyond human. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Mutant: Formulas</name>
        <text>You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulas that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.</text>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you choose to learn three mutagen formulas. Your formula options are detailed at the end of this order description. You gain an additional formula at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
        <text>Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulas you already know and replace it with another mutagen formula.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Mutant: Mutagen Craft</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you can take a short rest to concoct a single mutagen. Consuming a single mutagen requires a bonus action, and the effects (including side effects) last until you take a short or long rest to mediate and flush the toxins from your system.</text>
        <text>Mutagens are designed for your biology. They have no effect on large or larger creatures, and only impart the side effects on other medium or smaller creatures that drink the entire mutagen. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not swallowed before you finish your next short or long rest.</text>
        <text>Your body will begin to better utilize the toxins you instil it with as you grow in power and experience. These advancing mutations may be signified by a Mutation score.</text>
        <text>Mutation Score = your blood hunter level divided by 4, rounded up.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Order of the Mutant: Mutagen List</name>
        <text>These mutagens are presented in alphabetical order. You can learn a mutagen at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</text>
        <text>  • Aether. Prerequisite: 11th level. You gain a flying speed of 20 feet. Side effect: you have disadvantage on all Strength and Dexterity ability checks.</text>

        <name>Order of the Lycan</name>
        <text>Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within.</text>
        <text>The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo "The Taming, " a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one's own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order's blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</text>

        <name>Order of the Lycan: Hybrid Transformation</name>
        <text>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives in your blood. As an action, you can transform into your Hybrid form. This form lasts for 1 minute. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. The benefits of this form replace the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monster's Manual.</text>
        <text>You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:</text>
        <text>  • Feral Might. You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>

You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action. Unarmed strikes deal 1d4 slashing damage.</text>
        <text>  • Cursed Weakness. You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.</text>
        <text>  • Bloodlust. At the start of your turn, if you've taken any damage since the beginning of your last turn, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control. The DC equals 10, or 15 if you have no more than half of your hit points left. On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. Your turn immediately ends, and you regain control.</text>
        <text>If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the Barbarian's rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</text>

        <name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Vengeful Spirit</name>
        <text>Upon reaching 18th level, you learn to project your spirit to fight on while on the edge of death. Whenever your hit points drop to 0, you can choose to let your soul emerge from your body to fight on. Your body remains unconscious and subject to death saving throws per normal. At the beginning of your next turn, you manifest a spirit form in your space that picks up your weapons and continues fighting on, acting on your turn and every one of your subsequent turns under your control. Your spirit form has your physical attributes and armor class, as well as your weapons and ammunition, and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. This form is immune to cold, necrotic, and non-magical weapon damage. Your spirit form has access to all of your abilities other than your blood maledict feature.</text>
        <text>If your spirit form takes any damage, your body dies, or you regain any hit points, your spirit form vanishes. If your spirit form vanishes, it drops your weapons in its space.</text>

        <name>Martial Archetype: Gunslinger</name>
        <text>Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or polearm tactics.  Whether the duelist of infantry martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them.</text>
        <text>    However, some minds couldn't stop with the innovation of the crossbow.  Experimentation with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets of controlled explosive force.  The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.</text>
        <text>    This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons.  Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield.  However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack.  This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.</text>
        <text>    Should this path of powder, fire and metal call to you, keep your wits about you, hold onto your convictions as a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike true.</text>

        <name>Martial Archetype: Gunslinger: Firearm Properties</name>
        <text>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties.  Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of their property.  These properties replace the optional ones presented in the DM guide.  Firearms are ranged weapons.</text>
        <text>    RELOAD.  The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload.  You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</text>
        <text>    MISFIRE.  Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than weapon's Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it.  To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + Misfire score).  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.</text>
        <text>    SCATTER.  An attack is made against each creature within a 30 ft. cone.  These attacks are simultaneous.  If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage on a hit.  This attack cannot be affected by any of your shot features.</text>
        <text>    EXPLOSIVE.  Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft. of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage.  If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</text>

        <text>    Trick Shots: You learn two trick shots of your choice.  Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way.  Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made.  You can use only one trick shot per attack.</text>
        <text>    You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.  Each time you learn a trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Grit: You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).  You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion).  You gain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.</text>
        <text />
        <text>
          Saving Throws: Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effect.  The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Phoenix Sorcery (UA)</name>
        <text>Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix&#39;s power dwells within you.</text>
        <text>	That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can&#39;t bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</text>
        <text>	More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</text>
        <text>	Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</text>

        <text>Starting at 6th level, your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies&#39; protection.</text>
        <text>	As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your sorcerer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.</text>
        <text>	In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can teleport only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.</text>

    <text>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of making an attack. If the creature is taking an attack action with a nonmagical weapon, its attack action fails and has no effect. If it is taking an attack action with a magical weapon, it needs to make a Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target of the attack action has resistance to one of the damage types caused by the attack.  On a successful saving throw, the spell has no effect on the attack.</text>
