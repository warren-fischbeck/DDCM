        <name>Divine Domain: Twilight Domain (UA)</name>
        <text>The Twilight Domain governs the transition and blending of light into darkness. It is a time of rest and comfort, but also the threshold between safety and the unknown. Deities of healing or respite (such as Boldrei, Hestia, Mishakal, or Pelor), bravery or protection (such as Dol Arrah, Hajama, Helm, or Ilmater), travel or transition (such as Fharlanghn, Hermes, the Raven Queen, or the Traveler), or the night and dreams (such as Celestian, Morpheus, Nut, or Sel√ªne) might grant their clerics the Twilight Domain. Clerics who serve these deities tend to be brave, delving into the dark to hold its dangers at bay and to bring comfort to those lost far from the light.</text>
        <text>At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</text>

        <text>Druids who are members of the Circle of Wildfire understand the necessity of destruction, such as how a forest fire promotes growth.

        <text>   You have formed a mystical bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the fire bolt cantrip.</text>
        <text>   When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Wildfire Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&#39;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&#39;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</text>

        <text>2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature</text>
        <text>   You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.</text>
        <text>   The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 fire damage.</text>
        <text>   The wildfire spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature&#39;s game statistics in the wildfire spirit stat block. You determine the spirit&#39;s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.</text>
        <text>   In combat, the wildfire spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, Help, or Hide action.</text>
        <text>   The wildfire spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.</text>

When a Small or larger creature that you can see dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, you can use your reaction to cause primal flames to spring from the body. When a creature you can see touches these flames, the creature regains hit points or takes fire damage (your choice) equal to 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier. The flames vanish after a creature has touched them or after 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Onomancy (UA)</name>
        <text>Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.</text>
        <text>That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target&#39;s true name, the wizard&#39;s spells slip between the cracks of the target&#39;s defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Onomancy (UA): True Names (Onomancy (UA))</name>
        <text>Onomancy, or naming magic, is a method of spellcasting that uses a creature&#39;s true name to enhance a spell&#39;s effects. A true name is the name by which a self-aware creature identifies itself. This name might be the name a person was given at birth, or one a person chose or earned later in life. Whatever a name&#39;s origin, the simplest way for you to know your true name is to think truthfully about yourself and then think, "My name is..." Your true name is how you finish that sentence.</text>
        <text>   You can try to hide your true name by using a pseudonym, but you must be wary not to inhabit that false name too deeply. If a false name comes to be the best expression of who you are, it becomes your true name. Changing one&#39;s true name is never a quick choice; it&#39;s something that happens over time as a name becomes the creature&#39;s truth.</text>
        <text>   As a quick guide, a creature has a true name if it understands at least one language or it has an alignment.</text>

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can&#39;t use this feature on the target again.

        <text>   You have learned how to bypass a named creature&#39;s defenses against certain types of damage. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature whose true name you speak as part of casting the spell, you can cause the spell to deal force or psychic damage to the creature, instead of the spell&#39;s normal damage type.</text>
