If you drop the weapon or throw it, the weapon dissipates and reappears in your hand at the end of your turn.</text>
                <text>8 | A beam of brilliant light lances from your chest in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn.</text>
